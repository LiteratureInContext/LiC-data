                     increasing in importance. Schools prepared girls for the lives they would lead
                     within their socioeconomic class, while also seeking to teach "good morals and
                     behavior" (35). Boarding or day schools for girls were often used for
                     "finishing" in the genteel arts needed to secure a successful marriage (43). A
                     typical curriculum consisted of "needlecraft skills, the art of polite
                     conversation, dancing, music, drawing, painting, French, perhaps Italian, and
                     subjects...with which to make polite conversation" (44-45). Only girls from

                     woman's husband died, the widow was usually negatively economically impacted.
                     Widows, unlike wives, had a higher degree of authority and power over their own
                     economic lives and that of their children because they became legal heads of
                     household. This empowerment, however, threatened patriarchal order, which
                     depended on the economic subordination of women. In addition, widows in the
                     eighteenth century were often depicted as dangerously sexual because they were
                     not legally owned by a husband. Women were expected to mourn publicly and for
                     prolonged periods of time for their husbands, by "withdrawing from social life"
                     and wearing particular kinds of clothing (<ref

                     increasingly less "arranged," but financial arrangements were always made and
                     agreed upon before the marriage took place. Typically, this included agreements
                     about dowry and, especially, jointure. Frederica, poor after the death of her
                     father, would bring little to no dowry to her future husband, but Lady Susan
                     would hope to negotiate a large jointure. A jointure was the amount a husband
                     agrees to settle on his wife to support her after his death. In addition,
                     marriage settlements would include agreements for things like pin money. See H.

                     guardian" in their wills. Both paternal authority and guardianship ceased

                     Mainwaring would no longer have a legal guardian other than her, though we can
                     see in this novella that the personal relationship and dependency continues.

                  of spending our Christmas with you; and we are prevented that happiness by a
                  circumstance which is not likely to make us any amends. <persName>Lady

                  merely an affair of convenience, it is impossible to conjecture its length. I was
                  by no means prepared for such an event, nor can I now account for her ladyship's

                  increasing friendship for us since her husband's death that we should, at some
                  future period, be obliged to receive her. Mr. Vernon, I think, was a great deal

                  us at <placeName>Churchhill</placeName> perfectly unnecessary. Disposed, however,
                  as he always is to think the best of everyone, her display of grief, and
                  professions of regret, and general resolutions of prudence, were sufficient to
                  soften his heart and make him really confide in her sincerity; but, as for myself,
                  I am still unconvinced, and plausibly as her ladyship has now written, I cannot
                  make up my mind till I better understand her real meaning in coming to us. You may
                  guess, therefore, my dear madam, with what feelings I look forward to her arrival.
                  She will have occasion for all those attractive powers for which she is celebrated
                  to gain any share of my regard; and I shall certainly endeavour to guard myself
                  against their influence, if not accompanied by something more substantial. She
                  expresses a most eager desire of being acquainted with me, and makes very gracious
                  mention of my children but I am not quite weak enough to suppose a woman who has
                  behaved with inattention, if not with unkindness, to her own child, should be
                  attached to any of mine. <persName>Miss Vernon</persName> is to be placed at a

                  glad of, for her sake and my own. It must be to her advantage to be separated from
                  her mother, and a girl of sixteen who has received so wretched an education, could
                  not be a very desirable <pb n="209" facs="pageImages/209.jpg"/>companion here.

                     coquette is a flirt, or, according to the OED, one who uses "arts intended to

                  taught to consider her, but it has lately fallen in my way to hear some
                  particulars of her conduct at <placeName>Langford</placeName>: which prove that
                  she does not confine herself to that sort of honest flirtation which satisfies
                  most people, but aspires to the more delicious gratification of making a whole
                  family miserable. By her behaviour to <persName>Mr. Mainwaring</persName> she gave
                  jealousy and wretchedness to his wife, and by her attentions to a young man
                  previously attached to Mr. Mainwaring's sister deprived an amiable girl of her
                  lover. </p>
               <p>I learnt all this from <persName>Mr. Smith</persName>, now in this neighbourhood

                     eighteenth-century sense might suggest something of the sub-text here--an
                     engagement can also refer to a battle or conflict, which is often used in love

                  are not such as can persuade me of her being prepossessed in my favour. I wanted

                  which never succeeded at last. </p>

                  and as to money matters it has not withheld him from being very useful to me. I

                  fair, with fine grey eyes and dark eyelashes; and from her appearance one would
                  not suppose her more than five and twenty, though she must in fact be ten years
                  older, I was certainly not disposed to admire her, though always hearing she was

                  an attached friend. One is apt, I believe, to connect assurance of manner with
                  coquetry, and to expect that an impudent address will naturally attend an impudent

                  talks very well, with a happy command of language, which is too often used, I
                  believe, to make black appear white. She has already almost persuaded me of her
                  being warmly attached to her daughter, though I have been so long convinced to the
                  contrary. She speaks of her with so much tenderness and anxiety, lamenting so <pb

                  of life which she led with them from that to which she must now submit, I can only
                  suppose that the wish of establishing her reputation by following though late the
                  path of propriety, occasioned her removal from a family where she must in reality
                  have been particularly happy. Your friend <persName>Mr. Smith's</persName> story,
                  however, cannot be quite correct, as she corresponds regularly with <persName>Mrs.

                  possible that two men should be so grossly deceived by her at once. </p>

                  <salute>My dear Alicia,—</salute></opener>
               <p>You are very good in taking notice of <persName>Frederica</persName>, and I am
                  grateful for it as a mark of your friendship; but as I cannot have any doubt of
                  the warmth of your affection, I am far from exacting so heavy a sacrifice. She is
                  a stupid girl, and has nothing to recommend her. I would not, therefore, on my
                  account, have you encumber one moment of your precious time by sending for her to
                     <placeName>Edward Street</placeName>, especially as every visit is so much
                  deducted from the grand affair of <ref target="aEducation" corresp="nEducation"

                  to play and sing with some portion of taste and a good deal of assurance, as she
                  has my hand and arm and a tolerable voice. I was so much indulged in my infant

                  to finish a pretty woman. Not that I am an advocate for the prevailing fashion of
                  acquiring a perfect knowledge of all languages, arts, and sciences. It is throwing
                  time away to be mistress of French, Italian, and German: music, singing, and
                  drawing, &amp;, will gain a woman some applause, but will not add one lover to her
                  list—grace and manner, after all, are of the greatest importance. I do not mean,
                  therefore, that <persName>Frederica's</persName> acquirements should be more than
                  superficial, <pb n="216" facs="pageImages/216.jpg"/>and I flatter myself that she
                  will not remain long enough at school to understand anything thoroughly. I hope to
                  see her the wife of <persName>Sir James</persName> within a twelvemonth. You know
                  on what I ground my hope, and it is certainly a good foundation, for <ref

                     daughter. Schools for girls were meant to prepare them for future
                     marriage.</note>. And, by-the-by, you had better not invite her any more on
                  that account, as I wish her to find her situation as unpleasant as possible. I am
                  sure of <persName>Sir James</persName> at any time, and could make him renew his
                  application by a line. I shall trouble you meanwhile to prevent his forming any
                  other attachment when he comes to town. Ask him to your house occasionally, and
                  talk to him of <persName>Frederica</persName>, that he may not forget her. Upon
                  the whole, I commend my own conduct in this affair extremely, and regard it as a
                  very happy instance of circumspection and tenderness. Some mothers would have
                  insisted on their daughter's accepting so good an offer on the first overture; but
                  I could not reconcile it to myself to force <persName>Frederica</persName> into a
                  marriage from which her heart revolted, and instead of adopting so harsh a measure
                  merely propose to make it her own choice, by rendering her thoroughly
                  uncomfortable till she does accept him—but enough of this tiresome girl. You may
                  well wonder how I contrive to pass my time here, and for the first week it was
                  insufferably dull. Now, however, we begin to mend, our party is enlarged by Mrs.
                  Vernon's brother, a handsome young man, who promises me some amusement. There is
                  something about him which rather interests me, a sort of sauciness and familiarity
                     <pb n="217" facs="pageImages/217.jpg"/>which I shall teach him to correct. He
                  is lively, and seems clever, and when I have inspired him with greater respect for
                  me than his sister's kind offices have implanted, he may be an agreeable flirt.
                  There is exquisite pleasure in subduing an insolent spirit, in making a person
                  predetermined to dislike acknowledge one's superiority. I have disconcerted him

                  to say when you may see him in Kent. I will not disguise my sentiments on this

                     facs="pageImages/218.jpg"/>not communicate them to my father, whose excessive
                  anxiety about Reginald would subject him to an alarm which might seriously affect
                  his health and spirits. Lady Susan has certainly contrived, in the space of a
                  fortnight, to make my brother like her. In short, I am persuaded that his
                  continuing here beyond the time originally fixed for his return is occasioned as
                  much by a degree of fascination towards her, as by the wish of hunting with Mr.
                  Vernon, and of course I cannot receive that pleasure from the length of his visit
                  which my brother's company would otherwise give me. I am, indeed, provoked at the
                  artifice of this unprincipled woman; what stronger proof of her dangerous
                  abilities can be given than this perversion of Reginald's judgment, which when he
                  entered the house was so decidedly against her! In his last letter he actually
                  gave me some particulars of her behaviour at Langford, such as he received from a
                  gentleman who knew her perfectly well, which, if true, must raise abhorrence
                  against her, and which Reginald himself was entirely disposed to credit. His
                  opinion of her, I am sure, was as low as of any woman in England; and when he
                  first came it was evident that he considered her as one entitled neither to
                  delicacy nor respect, and that he felt she would be delighted with the attentions
                  of any man inclined to flirt with her. Her behaviour, I confess, has been
                  calculated to do away with such an idea; I have not detected the smallest
                  impropriety in it—nothing of vanity, of pretension, of levity; and she is
                  altogether so attractive that I should not wonder at his being delighted with <pb
                     n="219" facs="pageImages/219.jpg"/>her, had he known nothing of her previous to
                  this personal acquaintance; but, against reason, against conviction, to be so well
                  pleased with her, as I am sure he is, does really astonish me. His admiration was
                  at first very strong, but no more than was natural, and I did not wonder at his
                  being much struck by the gentleness and delicacy of her manners; but when he has
                  mentioned her of late it has been in terms of more extraordinary praise; and
                  yesterday he actually said that he could not be surprised at any effect produced
                  on the heart of man by such loveliness and such abilities; and when I lamented, in
                  reply, the badness of her disposition, he observed that whatever might have been
                  her errors they were to be imputed to her neglected education and early marriage,
                  and that she was altogether a wonderful woman. This tendency to excuse her conduct
                  or to forget it, in the warmth of admiration, vexes me; and if I did not know that
                  Reginald is too much at home at Churchhill to need an invitation for lengthening
                  his visit, I should regret Mr. Vernon's giving him any. Lady Susan's intentions
                  are of course those of absolute coquetry, or a desire of universal admiration; I
                  cannot for a moment imagine that she has anything more serious in view; but it
                  mortifies me to see a young man of Reginald's sense duped by her at all. </p>

               <p>I am much obliged to you, my dear Friend, for your advice respecting Mr. De

                  perhaps, till the old gentleman's death, be very little benefited by the match. It

                  sensible of my power, and can now enjoy the pleasure of triumphing over a mind
                  prepared to dislike me, and prejudiced against all my past actions. His sister,
                  too, is, I hope, convinced how little the ungenerous representations of anyone to
                  the disadvantage of another will avail when opposed by the immediate influence of
                  intellect and manner. I see plainly that she is uneasy at my progress in the good
                  opinion of her brother, and conclude that nothing will be wanting on her part to
                  counteract me; but having once made him doubt the justice of her opinion of me, I
                  think I may defy her. It has been delightful to me to watch his advances towards
                  intimacy, especially to observe his altered manner in consequence of my repressing
                  by the cool dignity of my deportment his insolent approach to direct familiarity.

                  have subdued him entirely by sentiment and serious conversation, and made him, I
                  may venture to say, at least half in love with me, without the semblance of the
                  most commonplace flirtation. Mrs. Vernon's consciousness of deserving every sort
                  of revenge that it can be in my power to inflict for her ill-offices could alone
                  enable her to perceive that I am actuated by any design in behaviour so gentle and
                  unpretending. Let her think and act as she chooses, however. I have never yet
                  found that the advice of a sister could prevent a young man's being in love if he
                  chose. We are advancing now to some kind of confidence, and in short are likely to
                  be engaged in a sort of platonic friendship. On my side you may be sure of its
                  never being more, for if I were not attached to another person as much as I can be
                  to anyone, I should make a point of not bestowing my affection on a man who had
                  dared to think so meanly of me. Reginald has a good figure and is not unworthy the
                  praise you have heard given him, but is still greatly inferior to our friend at
                  Langford. He is less polished, less insinuating than Mainwaring, and is
                  comparatively deficient in the power of saying those delightful things which put
                  one in good humour with oneself and all the world. He is quite agreeable enough,
                  however, to afford me amusement, and to make many of those hours pass very
                  pleasantly <pb n="223" facs="pageImages/223.jpg"/>which would otherwise be spent
                  in endeavouring to overcome my sister-in-law's reserve, and listening to the

               <p>I really grow quite uneasy, my dearest mother, about Reginald, from witnessing the
                  very rapid increase of Lady Susan's influence. They are now on terms of the most
                  particular friendship, frequently engaged in long conversations together; and she
                  has contrived by the most artful coquetry to subdue his judgment to her own
                  purposes. It is impossible to see the intimacy between them so very soon
                  established without some alarm, though I can hardly suppose that Lady Susan's
                  plans extend to marriage. I wish you could get Reginald home again on any
                  plausible pretence; he is not at all disposed to leave us, and I have given him as
                  many hints of my father's precarious state of health as common decency will allow
                  me to do in my own house. Her power over him must now be boundless, as she has
                  entirely effaced all his former ill-opinion, and persuaded him not merely to
                  forget but to justify her conduct. Mr. Smith's account of her proceedings at
                  Langford, where he <pb n="224" facs="pageImages/224.jpg"/>accused her of having
                  made Mr. Mainwaring and a young man engaged to Miss Mainwaring distractedly in
                  love with her, which Reginald firmly believed when he came here, is now, he is
                  persuaded, only a scandalous invention. He has told me so with a warmth of manner
                  which spoke his regret at having believed the contrary himself. How sincerely do I
                  grieve that she ever entered this house! I always looked forward to her coming
                  with uneasiness; but very far was it from originating in anxiety for Reginald.

                     people in higher classes, many marriages were arranged by parents while members
                     of the working class had the chance to marry out of love. Much of the problems
                     of marriages in the 18th century were amplified by the fact that leaving a
                     marriage and getting a divorce was a difficult thing; divorce courts were not

                     speaks to the son instead. Men had all of the power, because they had the land
                     and the inheritance. They provided for the family. Women did not have enough
                     power to be able to speak to men about a lot of things. They had to simply mind
                     their business and stay in a woman’s place. Yet, while it wouldn’t have been
                     appropriate for Lady de Courcy to chastise her son, she was within her duty to
                     ask her husband to do so. That is why the mother did not speak to Reginald, but

               <p>Unluckily I was confined to my room when your last letter came, by a cold which
                  affected my eyes so much as to prevent my reading it myself, so I could not refuse
                  your father when he offered to read it to me, by which means he became acquainted,
                  to my great <ref target="aVexation" corresp="nVexation">vexation</ref><note

                     According to the OED vexation means, "The action of troubling or harassing a
                     person by aggression or interference.<ref

                  to write to Reginald myself as soon as my eyes would let me, to point out, as well
                  as I could, the danger of an intimate acquaintance, with so artful a woman as Lady
                  Susan, to a young man of his age, and high expectations. I meant, moreover, to
                  have reminded him of our being quite alone now, and very much in need of him to
                  keep up our spirits these long winter evenings. Whether it would have done any
                  good <pb n="228" facs="pageImages/228.jpg"/>can never be settled now, but I am
                  excessively vexed that Sir Reginald should know anything of a matter which we
                  foresaw would make him so uneasy. He caught all your fears the moment he had read
                  your letter, and I am sure he has not had the business out of his head since. He
                  wrote by the same post to Reginald a long letter full of it all, and particularly
                  asking an explanation of what he may have heard from Lady Susan to contradict the
                  late shocking reports. His answer came this morning, which I shall enclose to you,
                  as I think you will like to see it. I wish it was more satisfactory; but it seems
                  written with such a determination to think well of Lady Susan, that his assurances
                  as to marriage, &amp;, do not set my heart at ease. I say all I can, however, to
                  satisfy your father, and he is certainly less uneasy since Reginald's letter. How
                  provoking it is, my dear Catherine, that this unwelcome guest of yours should not
                  only prevent our meeting this Christmas, but be the occasion of so much vexation
                  and trouble! Kiss the dear children for me. </p>

               </opener>
               <p> I have this moment received your letter, which has given me more astonishment
                  than I <pb n="229" facs="pageImages/229.jpg"/>ever felt before. I am to thank my
                  sister, I suppose, for having represented me in such a light as to injure me in
                  your opinion, and give you all this alarm. I know not why she should choose to
                  make herself and her family uneasy by apprehending an event which no one but
                  herself, I can affirm, would ever have thought possible. To impute such a design
                  to Lady Susan would be taking from her every claim to that excellent understanding
                  which her bitterest enemies have never denied her; and equally low must sink my
                  pretensions to common sense if I am suspected of matrimonial views in my behaviour
                  to her. <ref target="aAgeDifference" corresp="nAgeDifference">Our difference of

                     have been considered too old for Reginald De Courcy, who is 23, in the
                     eighteenth century. Because "women were extremely reliant on men for any legal
                     status, a property claim, or access to their wealth...pushed many women to
                     marry young" (Elsasser), especially so that children could be born to inherit.
                     Most women at the time were married between the average ages of 16 and 20 years
                     of age; however, the legal consent of marriage started as low as 12 years of
                     age. (<ref

                  your mind, and no longer harbour a suspicion which cannot be more injurious to
                  your own peace than to our understandings. I can have no other view in remaining
                  with Lady Susan, than to enjoy for a short time (as you have yourself expressed
                  it) the conversation of a woman of high intellectual powers. If Mrs. Vernon would
                  allow something to my affection for herself and her husband in the length of my
                  visit, she would do more justice to us all; but my sister is unhappily prejudiced
                  beyond the hope of conviction against Lady Susan. From an attachment to her
                  husband, which in itself does honour to both, she cannot forgive the endeavours at
                  preventing their union, which have been attributed to selfishness in Lady Susan;
                  but in this case, as well as in many others, the world has most grossly injured
                  that lady, by supposing the worst where the motives of her <pb n="230"
                     facs="pageImages/230.jpg"/>conduct have been doubtful. Lady Susan had heard
                  something so materially to the disadvantage of my sister as to persuade her that
                  the happiness of Mr. Vernon, to whom she was always much attached, would be wholly
                  destroyed by the marriage. And this circumstance, while it explains the true
                  motives of Lady Susan's conduct, and removes all the blame which has been so
                  lavished on her, may also convince us how little the general report of anyone
                  ought to be credited; since no character, however upright, can escape the
                  malevolence of slander. If my sister, in the security of retirement, with as
                  little opportunity as inclination to do evil, could not avoid censure, we must not
                  rashly condemn those who, living in the world and surrounded with temptations,
                  should be accused of errors which they are known to have the power of committing. </p>
               <p> I blame myself severely for having so easily believed the slanderous tales
                  invented by Charles Smith to the prejudice of Lady Susan, as I am now convinced
                  how greatly they have <ref target="aTraduced" corresp="nTraduced"

                  young lady to pay her some attention; and as he is a man of <ref

                     status through monetary gain. <ref

                  extended to marriage. It is well known that Miss M. is absolutely on the catch for
                  a husband, and no one therefore can pity her for losing, by the superior
                  attractions of another woman, the chance of being able to make a <pb n="231"
                     facs="pageImages/231.jpg"/>worthy man completely wretched. Lady Susan was far
                  from intending such a conquest, and on finding how warmly Miss Mainwaring resented
                  her lover's defection, determined, in spite of Mr. and Mrs. Mainwaring's most
                  urgent entreaties, to leave the family. I have reason to imagine she did receive
                  serious proposals from Sir James, but her removing to Langford immediately on the
                  discovery of his attachment, must acquit her on that article with any mind of
                  common candour. You will, I am sure, my dear Sir, feel the truth of this, and will
                  hereby learn to do justice to the<ref target="aCharacter" corresp="nCharacter"

                  coming to Churchhill was governed only by the most honourable and amiable
                  intentions; her prudence and economy are exemplary, her regard for Mr. Vernon
                  equal even to HIS deserts; and her wish of obtaining my sister's good opinion
                  merits a better return than it has received. As a mother she is unexceptionable;
                  her solid affection for her child is shown by placing her in hands where her
                  education will be properly attended to; but because she has not the blind and weak
                  partiality of most mothers, she is accused of wanting maternal tenderness. Every
                  person of sense, however, will know how to value and commend her well-directed
                  affection, and will join me in wishing that Frederica Vernon may prove more worthy
                  than she has yet done of her mother's tender care. I have now, my dear father,
                  written my real sentiments of Lady Susan; you will know from this letter how
                  highly I admire her abilities, and esteem her character; but if you are not

               <p> I return you Reginald's letter, and rejoice with all my heart that my father is
                  made easy by it: tell him so, with my congratulations; but, between ourselves, I
                  must own it has only convinced ME of my brother's having no PRESENT intention of
                  marrying Lady Susan, not that he is in no danger of doing so three months hence.
                  He gives a very plausible account of her behaviour at Langford; I wish it may be
                  true, but his intelligence must come from herself, and I am less disposed to
                  believe it than to lament the degree of intimacy subsisting between them, implied
                  by the discussion of such a subject. I am sorry to have incurred his displeasure,
                  but can expect nothing better while he is so very eager in Lady Susan's
                  justification. He is very severe against me indeed, and yet I hope I have not been

                     Judgement is considered going beyond empirical evidence to draw a conclusion.
                     In the eighteenth century, the period of the Enlightenment, questions about the
                     nature of judgement permeated intellectual conversation. Read more about

                  woman! though I have reasons enough for my dislike, I cannot help pitying her at
                  present, as she is in real distress, and with too much cause. She had this morning
                  a letter from the lady with whom she has <pb n="233" facs="pageImages/233.jpg"
                  />placed her daughter, to request that Miss Vernon might be immediately removed,
                  as she had been detected in an attempt to run away. Why, or whither she intended
                  to go, does not appear; but, as her situation seems to have been unexceptionable,
                  it is a sad thing, and of course highly distressing to Lady Susan. Frederica must
                  be as much as sixteen, and ought to know better; but from what her mother
                  insinuates, I am afraid she is a perverse girl. She has been sadly neglected,
                  however, and her mother ought to remember it. Mr. Vernon set off for London as
                  soon as she had determined what should be done. He is, if possible, to prevail on
                  Miss Summers to let Frederica continue with her; and if he cannot succeed, to
                  bring her to Churchhill for the present, till some other situation can be found
                  for her. Her ladyship is comforting herself meanwhile by strolling along the
                  shrubbery with Reginald, calling forth all his tender feelings, I suppose, on this
                  distressing occasion. She has been talking a great deal about it to me. She talks
                  vastly well; I am afraid of being ungenerous, or I should say, TOO well to feel so
                  very deeply; but I will not look for her faults; she may be Reginald's wife!
                  Heaven forbid it! but why should I be quicker-sighted than anyone else? Mr. Vernon
                  declares that he never saw deeper distress than hers, on the receipt of the
                  letter; and is his judgment inferior to mine? She was very unwilling that
                  Frederica should be allowed to come to Churchhill, and justly enough, as it seems
                  a sort of reward to behaviour deserving very differently; but it was impossible to
                  take her anywhere <pb n="234" facs="pageImages/234.jpg"/>else, and she is not to
                  remain here long. "It will be absolutely necessary," said she, "as you, my dear
                  sister, must be sensible, to treat my daughter with some severity while she is
                  here; a most painful necessity, but I will ENDEAVOUR to submit to it. I am afraid
                  I have often been too indulgent, but my poor Frederica's temper could never bear
                  opposition well: you must support and encourage me; you must urge the necessity of
                  reproof if you see me too lenient." All this sounds very reasonable. Reginald is
                  so incensed against the poor silly girl. Surely it is not to Lady Susan's credit
                  that he should be so bitter against her daughter; his idea of her must be drawn
                  from the mother's description. Well, whatever may be his fate, we have the comfort
                  of knowing that we have done our utmost to save him. We must commit the event to a

               <p>Never, my dearest Alicia, was I so provoked in my life as by a letter this morning
                  from Miss Summers. That horrid girl of mine has been trying to run away. I had not
                  a notion of her being such a little devil before, she seemed to have all the
                  Vernon milkiness; but on receiving the letter in which I declared my intention
                  about Sir James, she actually attempted to <pb n="235" facs="pageImages/235.jpg"
                  />elope; at least, I cannot otherwise account for her doing it. She meant, I
                  suppose, to go to the Clarkes in Staffordshire, for she has no other
                  acquaintances. <ref target="aPunished" corresp="nPunished">But she shall be

                     type="editorial">Lady Susan’s desire for Frederica to marry comes from her need
                     of money to sustain her way of life and social status. Marriage in the
                     eighteenth century was most commonly done for other needs, rather than love.
                     "Couples wed to make political alliances, to raise capital, to expand the
                     workforce and for a whole array of practical purpose" (Salt Lake Tribune).

                  matters up if he can, for I do not by any means want her here. If Miss Summers
                  will not keep her, you must find me out another school, unless we can get her
                  married immediately. Miss S. writes word that she could not get the young lady to
                  assign any cause for her extraordinary conduct, which confirms me in my own
                  previous explanation of it. Frederica is too shy, I think, and too much in awe of
                  me to tell tales, but if the mildness of her uncle should get anything out of her,
                  I am not afraid. I trust I shall be able to make my story as good as hers. If I am
                  vain of anything, it is of my eloquence. Consideration and esteem as surely follow
                  command of language as admiration waits on beauty, and here I have opportunity
                  enough for the exercise of my talent, as the chief of my time is spent in
                  conversation. </p>

                     toRobert Clark, shrubberies and wilderness gardens were open stretches of land
                     that were usually filled with bordering rows of bushes and trees, which could
                     also be accompanied with lakes or installations. These large gardens were a
                     type of status symbol and were also made for the garden owner's pleasure
                     (Clark). These gardens or shrubberies allowed for parties to communicate with
                     each other and partake in walks observing the garden with the garden
                     installations also encouraging conversation (Clark). (<ref

                  clever and has a good deal to say, but he is sometimes impertinent and
                  troublesome. There is a sort of ridiculous delicacy about him which requires the
                  fullest explanation of whatever he may have heard to my disadvantage, and is never
                  satisfied till he thinks he has ascertained the beginning and end of everything.
                  This is one sort of love, <pb n="236" facs="pageImages/236.jpg"/>but I confess it
                  does not particularly recommend itself to me. I infinitely prefer the tender and
                  liberal spirit of Mainwaring, which, impressed with the deepest conviction of my
                  merit, is satisfied that whatever I do must be right; and look with a degree of
                  contempt on the inquisitive and doubtful fancies of that heart which seems always
                  debating on the reasonableness of its emotions. Mainwaring is indeed, beyond all
                  compare, superior to Reginald—superior in everything but the power of being with
                  me! Poor fellow! he is much distracted by jealousy, which I am not sorry for, as I
                  know no better support of love. He has been teazing me to allow of his coming into

               <p> Mr. Vernon returned on Thursday night, bringing his niece with him. Lady Susan
                  had received a line from him by that day's <ref target="aPost" corresp="nPost"

                     resp="editors.xml#BS">The post, or mail service, was introduced in the
                     seventeenth century. Carriers brought letters from one post or station to
                     another on foot or horseback. "Post" refers both to the letters themselves, and
                     to the mail system more broadly(<ref

                  refused to allow of Miss Vernon's continuance in her academy; we were therefore
                  prepared for her arrival, and expected them impatiently the whole evening. <pb
                     n="237" facs="pageImages/237.jpg"/>They came while we were at tea, and I never
                  saw any creature look so frightened as Frederica when she entered the room. Lady
                  Susan, who had been shedding tears before, and showing great agitation at the idea
                  of the meeting, received her with perfect self-command, and without betraying the
                  least tenderness of spirit. She hardly spoke to her, and on Frederica's bursting
                  into tears as soon as we were seated, took her out of the room, and did not return
                  for some time. When she did, her eyes looked very red and she was as much agitated
                  as before. We saw no more of her daughter. Poor Reginald was beyond measure
                  concerned to see his fair friend in such distress, and watched her with so much
                  tender solicitude, that I, who occasionally caught her observing his countenance
                  with exultation, was quite out of patience. This pathetic representation lasted
                  the whole evening, and so ostentatious and artful a display has entirely convinced
                  me that she did in fact feel nothing. I am more angry with her than ever since I
                  have seen her daughter; the poor girl looks so unhappy that my heart aches for
                  her. Lady Susan is surely too severe, for Frederica does not seem to have the sort
                  of temper to make severity necessary. She looks perfectly timid, dejected, and
                  penitent. She is very pretty, though not so handsome as her mother, nor at all
                  like her. Her complexion is delicate, but neither so fair nor so blooming as Lady
                  Susan's, and she has quite the Vernon cast of countenance, the oval face and mild
                  dark eyes, and there is peculiar sweetness in her look when she speaks either to
                  her uncle or <pb n="238" facs="pageImages/238.jpg"/>me, for as we behave kindly to
                  her we have of course engaged her gratitude. </p>
               <p>Her mother has insinuated that her temper is intractable, but I never saw a face
                  less indicative of any evil disposition than hers; and from what I can see of the
                  behaviour of each to the other, the invariable severity of Lady Susan and the
                  silent dejection of Frederica, I am led to believe as heretofore that the former
                  has no real love for her daughter, and has never done her justice or treated her
                  affectionately. I have not been able to have any conversation with my niece; she
                  is shy, and I think I can see that some pains are taken to prevent her being much
                  with me. Nothing satisfactory transpires as to her reason for running away. Her
                  kind-hearted uncle, you may be sure, was too fearful of distressing her to ask
                  many questions as they travelled. I wish it had been possible for me to fetch her
                  instead of him. I think I should have discovered the truth in the course of a
                  thirty-mile journey. The small pianoforte has been removed within these few days,
                  at Lady Susan's request, into her dressing-room, and Frederica spends great part
                  of the day there, practising as it is called; but I seldom hear any noise when I
                  pass that way; what she does with herself there I do not know. There are plenty of
                  books, but it is not every girl who has been running wild the first fifteen years
                  of her life, that can or will read. Poor creature! the prospect from her window is
                  not very instructive, for that room overlooks the lawn, you know, with the
                  shrubbery on one side, where she may see her mother <pb n="239"
                     facs="pageImages/239.jpg"/>walking for an hour together in earnest conversation
                  with Reginald. A girl of Frederica's age must be childish indeed, if such things
                  do not strike her. Is it not inexcusable to give such an example to a daughter?
                  Yet Reginald still thinks Lady Susan the best of mothers, and still condemns
                  Frederica as a worthless girl! He is convinced that her attempt to run away
                  proceeded from no, justifiable cause, and had no provocation. I am sure I cannot
                  say that it HAD, but while Miss Summers declares that Miss Vernon showed no signs
                  of obstinacy or perverseness during her whole stay in Wigmore Street, till she was
                  detected in this scheme, I cannot so readily credit what Lady Susan has made him,
                  and wants to make me believe, that it was merely an impatience of restraint and a
                  desire of escaping from the tuition of masters which brought on the plan of an
                  elopement. <ref target="aEnslaved" corresp="nEnslaved">O Reginald, how is your
                     judgment enslaved!</ref><note xml:id="nEnslaved" target="aEnslaved"
                     type="editorial" resp="editors.xml#WR">Reginald's belief that Frederica
                     attempted to run away for no reason and that Lady Susan is not to blame may be
                     a result of blind love and unwillingness to face the truth. "In light of the
                     complexity typical of love and the fact that lovers are often unwilling to face
                     reality, self-deception and mistakes are likely to occur" (Ben-Zeév). When one
                     is in love with another it is easy to forgive or ignore negative aspects of
                     their partner. (<ref

                  handsome, and when I speak of her beauty, replies only that her eyes have no
                  brilliancy! Sometimes he is sure she is deficient in understanding, and at others
                  that her temper only is in fault. In short, when a person is always to deceive, it
                  is impossible to be consistent. Lady Susan finds it necessary that Frederica
                  should be to blame, and probably has sometimes judged it expedient to excuse her
                  of ill-nature and sometimes to lament her want of sense. Reginald is only
                  repeating after her ladyship.</p>

                     Vernon</persName> has interested you, for I do believe her truly deserving of
                  your regard; and when I have communicated a notion which has recently struck me,
                  your kind impressions in her favour will, I am sure, be heightened. I cannot help
                  fancying that she is growing partial to my brother. I so very often see her eyes
                  fixed on his face with a remarkable expression of pensive admiration. He is
                  certainly very handsome; and yet more, there is an openness in his manner that
                  must be highly prepossessing, and I am sure she feels it so. Thoughtful and
                  pensive in general, her countenance always brightens into a smile when
                     <persName>Reginald</persName> says anything amusing; and, let the subject be
                  ever so serious that he may be conversing on, I am much mistaken if a syllable of
                  his uttering escapes her. I want to make him sensible of all this, for we know the

                     Austen’s Novels," Barbara Horwitz points out that Lady Susan uses the language
                     of conduct books on female education, but does not follow their spirit. She
                     "not only brings up her daughter improperly and cruelly, obviously ignoring the
                     spirit of the conduct books; she uses their precepts, and even their very own

                  she is by no means so ignorant as one might expect to find her, being fond of
                  books and spending the chief of her time in reading. Her mother leaves her more to
                  herself than she did, and I have her with me as much as possible, and have taken
                  great pains to overcome her timidity. We are very good friends, and though she
                  never opens her lips before her mother, she talks enough when alone with me to
                  make it clear that, if properly treated by <persName>Lady Susan</persName>, she
                  would always appear to much greater advantage. There cannot be a more gentle,
                  affectionate heart; or more obliging manners, when acting without restraint; and
                  her little cousins are all very fond of her. </p>

                     <persName>Frederica</persName>, and perhaps may think me negligent for not
                  writing before. She arrived with her uncle last Thursday fortnight, when, of
                  course, I lost no time in demanding the cause of her behaviour; and soon found
                  myself to have been perfectly right in attributing it to my own letter. The
                  prospect of it frightened her so thoroughly, that, with a mixture of true girlish
                  perverseness and folly, she resolved on getting out of the house and proceeding
                  directly by the stage to her friends, the Clarkes; and had really <pb n="242"

                  journey when she was fortunately missed, pursued, and overtaken. Such was the
                  first distinguished exploit of <persName>Miss Frederica Vernon</persName>; and, if
                  we consider that it was achieved at the tender age of sixteen, we shall have room

                     Mrs. Vernon is asking Lady De Courcy to sanction their marriage. </note>. I
                  never saw a girl of her age bid fairer to be the sport of mankind. Her feelings
                  are tolerably acute, and she is so charmingly artless in their display as to
                  afford the most reasonable hope of her being ridiculous, and despised by every man
                  who sees her. Artlessness will never do in love matters; and that girl is born a
                  simpleton who has it either by nature or affectation. I am not yet certain that
                     <persName>Reginald</persName> sees what she is about, nor is it of much
                  consequence. She is now an object of indifference to him, and she would be one of
                  contempt were he to understand <pb n="242 [page breaks after under-]"
                     facs="pageImages/242.jpg"/>her emotions. Her beauty is much admired by the
                  Vernons, but it has no effect on him. She is in high favour with her aunt
                  altogether, because she is so little like myself, of course. She is exactly the
                  companion for <persName>Mrs. Vernon</persName>, who dearly loves to be firm, and
                  to have all the sense and all the wit of the conversation to herself:
                     <persName>Frederica</persName> will never eclipse her. When she first came I
                  was at some pains to prevent her seeing much of her aunt; but I have relaxed, as I
                  believe I may depend on her observing the rules I have laid down for their
                  discourse. But do not imagine that with all this lenity I have for a moment given
                  up my plan of her marriage. No; I am unalterably fixed on this point, though I
                  have not yet quite decided on the manner of bringing it about. I should not chuse
                  to have the business brought on here, and canvassed by the wise heads of Mr. and
                     <persName>Mrs. Vernon</persName>; and I cannot just now afford to go to town.
                     <persName>Miss Frederica</persName> must therefore wait a little. </p>

                     facs="pageImages/244.jpg"/>came running up, and rushed by me into her own room.
                  I instantly followed, and asked her what was the matter. <said direct="true"

                  explanation; I begged her to tell me what she meant. At that moment we were
                  interrupted by a knock at the door: it was <persName>Reginald</persName>, who
                  came, by <persName>Lady Susan</persName>'s direction, to call

                     their meals. They are different in that "dining rooms were most often used only
                     for formal dinners". This is common with the a new trend in Austen’s time where
                     "instead of the multi-purpose hall, rooms were being used for specific
                     purposes: there was a billiard room, a music room, a library…" </note> we found
                     <persName>Lady Susan</persName>, and a young man of gentlemanlike appearance,
                  whom she introduced by the name of <persName>Sir James Martin</persName>—the very
                  person, as you may remember, whom it was said she had been at pains to detach from
                     <persName>Miss Mainwaring</persName>; but the conquest, it seems, was not
                  designed for herself, or she has since transferred it to her daughter; for
                     <persName>Sir James</persName> is now desperately in love with
                     <persName>Frederica</persName>, and with full encouragement from mamma. The
                  poor girl, however, I am sure, dislikes him; and though his person and address are
                  very well, he appears, both to <persName>Mr. Vernon</persName> and me, a very weak
                  young man. <persName>Frederica</persName> looked so shy, so confused, when we
                  entered the room, that I felt for her exceedingly. <persName>Lady Susan</persName>
                  behaved with great attention to her visitor; and yet I thought I could perceive
                  that she had no particular pleasure in seeing him. <persName>Sir James</persName>
                  talked a great deal, and made many civil excuses to me for the liberty he had
                  taken in coming to <placeName>Churchhill</placeName>—mixing <pb n="245"
                     facs="pageImages/245.jpg"/>more frequent laughter with his discourse than the

                  a few evenings before. He now and then addressed <persName>Frederica</persName>,
                  but more frequently her mother. The poor girl sat all this time without opening

                     <persName>Reginald</persName> observed all that passed in perfect silence. At

                  permission to attend me for a few moments in my dressing-room, as she was anxious
                  to speak with me in private. I led her thither accordingly, and as soon as the
                  door was closed, she said: <said direct="true">"I was never more surprized in my
                     life than by <persName>Sir James</persName>'s arrival, and the suddenness of it
                     requires some apology to you, my dear sister; though to ME, as a mother, it is
                     highly flattering. He is so extremely attached to my daughter that he could not
                     exist longer without seeing her. <persName>Sir James</persName> is a young man

                     is in other respects so very eligible a match for
                        <persName>Frederica</persName>, that I have always observed his attachment
                     with the greatest pleasure; and am persuaded that you and my brother will give
                     the alliance your hearty approbation. I have never before mentioned the
                     likelihood of its taking place to anyone, because I thought that whilst
                        <persName>Frederica</persName> continued at <pb n="246"
                        facs="pageImages/246.jpg"/>school it had better not be known to exist; but
                     now, as I am convinced that <persName>Frederica</persName> is too old ever to
                     submit to school confinement, and have, therefore, begun to consider her union
                     with <persName>Sir James</persName> as not very distant, I had intended within
                     a few days to acquaint yourself and <persName>Mr. Vernon</persName> with the
                     whole business. I am sure, my dear sister, you will excuse my remaining silent
                     so long, and agree with me that such circumstances, while they continue from
                     any cause in suspense, cannot be too cautiously concealed. When you have the
                     happiness of bestowing your sweet little <persName>Catherine</persName>, some
                     years hence, on a man who in connection and character is alike unexceptionable,
                     you will know what I feel now; though, thank Heaven, you cannot have all my
                     reasons for rejoicing in such an event. <persName>Catherine</persName> will be
                     amply provided for, and not, like my <persName>Frederica</persName>, indebted
                     to a fortunate establishment for the comforts of life."</said> She concluded by
                  demanding my congratulations. I gave them somewhat awkwardly, I believe; for, in
                  fact, the sudden disclosure of so important a matter took from me the power of
                  speaking with any clearness. She thanked me, however, most affectionately, for my
                  kind concern in the welfare of herself and daughter; and then said: <said

                     I declare, that much as I had heard in your praise before I knew you, I had no
                     idea that I should ever love you as I now do; and I must further say that your
                     friendship towards <pb n="247" facs="pageImages/247.jpg"/>me is more
                     particularly gratifying because I have reason to believe that some attempts
                     were made to prejudice you against me. I only wish that they, whoever they are,
                     to whom I am indebted for such kind intentions, could see the terms on which we
                     now are together, and understand the real affection we feel for each other; but
                     I will not detain you any longer. God bless you, for your goodness to me and my
                     girl, and continue to you all your present happiness."</said> What can one say
                  of such a woman, my dear mother? Such earnestness such solemnity of expression!
                  and yet I cannot help suspecting the truth of everything she says. As for
                     <persName>Reginald</persName>, I believe he does not know what to make of the
                  matter. When <persName>Sir James</persName> came, he appeared all astonishment and
                  perplexity; the folly of the young man and the confusion of
                     <persName>Frederica</persName> entirely engrossed him; and though a little
                  private discourse with <persName>Lady Susan</persName> has since had its effect,
                  he is still hurt, I am sure, at her allowing of such a man's attentions to her
                  daughter. <persName>Sir James</persName> invited himself with great composure to
                  remain here a few days—hoped we would not think it odd, was aware of its being
                  very impertinent, but he took the liberty of a relation; and concluded by wishing,
                  with a laugh, that he might be really one very soon. Even <persName>Lady
                     Susan</persName> seemed a little disconcerted by this forwardness; in her heart
                  I am persuaded she sincerely wished him gone. But something must be done for this
                  poor girl, if her feelings are such as both I and her uncle believe them to be.
                  She must not be sacrificed to policy or ambition, and she <pb n="248"
                     facs="pageImages/248.jpg"/>must not be left to suffer from the dread of it. The
                  girl whose heart can distinguish <persName>Reginald De Courcy</persName>,
                  deserves, however he may slight her, a better fate than to be <persName>Sir James
                     Martin</persName>'s wife. As soon as I can get her alone, I will discover the
                  real truth; but she seems to wish to avoid me. I hope this does not proceed from
                  anything wrong, and that I shall not find out I have thought too well of her. Her
                  behaviour to <persName>Sir James</persName> certainly speaks the greatest
                  consciousness and embarrassment, but I see nothing in it more like encouragement.
                  Adieu, my dear mother. </p>

                     Vernon’s decision to write to Mr. De Courcy. In this period, Miss Vernon’s
                     actions are considered controversial as single women were not meant to write to
                     other men. <ref

                     women "inhabited what Victorians thought of as ‘separate spheres’, only coming
                     together at breakfast and again at dinner." Single women "were not even allowed
                     to speak to men unless there was a married woman present as a chaperone."
                  </note>; I am forced upon it by the greatest distress, or I should be ashamed to
                  trouble you. I am very miserable about <persName>Sir James Martin</persName>, and
                  have no other way in the world of helping myself but by writing to you, for I am
                  forbidden even speaking to my uncle and aunt on the subject; and this being the
                  case, I am afraid my applying to you will appear no better than equivocation, and
                  as if I attended to <ref target="aLetterSpirit" corresp="nLetterSpirit">the letter

                     to the Bible here. In 2 Corinthians 3:6, God has "made us able ministers of the
                     new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth,
                     but the spirit giveth life" (King James Version). In other words, Frederica is
                     worried that she is being disobedient to her mother’s injunction not to speak
                     to Mr. or Catherine Vernon in writing to Reginald.</note>. But if you do not
                  take my part and persuade her to break it off, I shall be half distracted, for I
                  cannot bear him. No human being but YOU could have any chance of prevailing with
                  her. <pb n="249" facs="pageImages/249.jpg"/>If you will, therefore, have the
                  unspeakably great kindness of taking my part with her, and persuading her to send
                     <persName>Sir James</persName> away, I shall be more obliged to you than it is
                  possible for me to express. I always disliked him from the first: it is not a
                  sudden fancy, I assure you, sir; I always thought him silly and impertinent and
                  disagreeable, and now he is grown worse than ever. I would rather work for my
                  bread than marry him. I do not know how to apologize enough for this letter; I
                  know it is taking so great a liberty. I am aware how dreadfully angry it will make
                  mamma, but I remember the risk. </p>

               <p>This is insufferable! My dearest friend, I was never so enraged before, and must
                  relieve myself by writing to you, who I know will enter into all my feelings. Who
                  should come on Tuesday but <persName>Sir James Martin</persName>! Guess my
                  astonishment, and vexation—for, as you well know, I never wished him to be seen at
                     <placeName>Churchhill</placeName>. What a pity that you should not have known
                  his intentions! Not content with coming, he actually invited himself to remain
                  here a few days. I could have poisoned him! I made the best of it, however, and
                  told my story with great success to <persName>Mrs. Vernon</persName>, who,
                  whatever might be her real sentiments, said <pb n="250" facs="pageImages/250.jpg"
                  />nothing in opposition to mine. I made a point also of
                     <persName>Frederica</persName>'s behaving civilly to <persName>Sir
                     James</persName>, and gave her to understand that I was absolutely determined
                  on her marrying him. She said something of her misery, but that was all. I have
                  for some time been more particularly resolved on the match from seeing the rapid
                  increase of her affection for <persName>Reginald</persName>, and from not feeling
                  secure that a knowledge of such affection might not in the end awaken a return.
                  Contemptible as a regard founded only on compassion must make them both in my
                  eyes, I felt by no means assured that such might not be the consequence. It is
                  true that <persName>Reginald</persName> had not in any degree grown cool towards
                  me; but yet he has lately mentioned <persName>Frederica</persName> spontaneously
                  and unnecessarily, and once said something in praise of her person. HE was all
                  astonishment at the appearance of my visitor, and at first observed <persName>Sir
                     James</persName> with an attention which I was pleased to see not unmixed with
                  jealousy; but unluckily it was impossible for me really to torment him, as
                     <persName>Sir James</persName>, though extremely gallant to me, very soon made
                  the whole party understand that his heart was devoted to my daughter. I had no
                  great difficulty in convincing <persName>De Courcy</persName>, when we were alone,
                  that I was perfectly justified, all things considered, in desiring the match; and
                  the whole business seemed most comfortably arranged. They could none of them help
                  perceiving that <persName>Sir James</persName>
                  <ref target="aNoSolomon" corresp="nNoSolomon">was no Solomon</ref><note

                     >Lady Susan references the biblical story of of Solomon, King of Israel (1
                     Kings 3:16–28). However, she provides a superficial allusion only to Solomon's
                     wisdom. Her chief intention here seems to be to show how well-read she is in
                     the Bible. In the story of the Judgment of King Solomon, two new mothers live
                     in the same house; one infant dies, and both mothers claim the other as their
                     own. To determine who the true mother is, Solomon suggests cutting the baby in
                     two and giving each mother a piece. The true mother renounces her claim, and so
                     Solomon's wisdom was known.</note>; but I had positively forbidden
                     <persName>Frederica</persName> complaining to <persName>Charles
                     Vernon</persName> or his wife, and they had therefore no pretence for
                  interference; though my impertinent <pb n="251" facs="pageImages/251.jpg"/>sister,
                  I believe, wanted only opportunity for doing so. Everything, however, was going on
                  calmly and quietly; and, though I counted the hours of <persName>Sir
                     James</persName>'s stay, my mind was entirely satisfied with the posture of
                  affairs. Guess, then, what I must feel at the sudden disturbance of all my
                  schemes; and that, too, from a quarter where I had least reason to expect it.
                     <persName>Reginald</persName> came this morning into my dressing-room with a
                  very unusual solemnity of countenance, and after some preface informed me in so
                  many words that he wished to reason with me on the impropriety and unkindness of
                  allowing <persName>Sir James Martin</persName> to address my daughter contrary to
                  her inclinations. I was all amazement. When I found that he was not to be laughed
                  out of his design, I calmly begged an explanation, and desired to know by what he
                  was impelled, and by whom commissioned, to reprimand me. He then <said
                     direct="false">told me, mixing in his speech a few insolent compliments and
                     ill-timed expressions of tenderness, to which I listened with perfect
                     indifference, that my daughter had acquainted him with some circumstances
                     concerning herself, <persName>Sir James</persName>, and me which had given him
                     great uneasiness</said>. In short, I found that she had in the first place
                  actually written to him to request his interference, and that, on receiving her
                  letter, he had conversed with her on the subject of it, in order to understand the
                  particulars, and to assure himself of her real wishes. I have not a doubt but that
                  the girl took this opportunity of making downright love to him. I am convinced of
                  it by the manner in which he spoke of her. Much good may such love do him! I shall
                     <pb n="252" facs="pageImages/252.jpg"/>ever despise the man who can be
                  gratified by the passion which he never wished to inspire, nor solicited the
                  avowal of. I shall always detest them both. He can have no true regard for me, or
                  he would not have listened to her; and SHE, with her little rebellious heart and
                  indelicate feelings, to throw herself into the protection of a young man with whom
                  she has scarcely ever exchanged two words before! I am equally confounded at HER
                  impudence and HIS credulity. How dared he believe what she told him in my
                  disfavour! Ought he not to have felt assured that I must have unanswerable motives
                  for all that I had done? Where was his reliance on my sense and goodness then?
                  Where the resentment which true love would have dictated against the person
                  defaming me—that person, too, a <ref target="aChit" corresp="nChit"

                  he had been always taught to despise? I was calm for some time; but the greatest
                  degree of forbearance may be overcome, and I hope I was afterwards sufficiently
                  keen. He endeavoured, long endeavoured, to soften my resentment; but that woman is
                  a fool indeed who, while insulted by accusation, can be worked on by compliments.
                  At length he left me, as deeply provoked as myself; and he showed his anger more.
                  I was quite cool, but he gave way to the most violent indignation; I may therefore
                  expect it will the sooner subside, and perhaps his may be vanished for ever, while
                  mine will be found still fresh and implacable. He is now shut up in his apartment,
                  whither I heard him go on leaving mine. How unpleasant, one would think, must be
                  his <pb n="253 [page breaks after reflec-]" facs="pageImages/253.jpg"

                  tranquillised myself enough to see <persName>Frederica</persName>. SHE shall not
                  soon forget the occurrences of this day; she shall find that she has poured forth
                  her tender tale of love in vain, and exposed herself for ever to the contempt of
                  the whole world, and the severest resentment of her injured mother. </p>

                     short lines in this context is a brief letter. According to a review by Tracy
                     Kiely, in the 18th century people entrusted their friends, family members or
                     others traveling to deliver their letters and serve as messengers. Only the
                     wealthy could afford postal services. (<ref

                     only used for formal dinners most of the time. It has always been a custom to
                     have breakfast together throughout England. Families often had their breakfast
                     in a room called the breakfast parlour, and it is where they would meet in the
                     early mornings (<ref

                  brother called me out of the room. I instantly saw that something was the matter;
                  his complexion was raised, and he spoke with great emotion; you know his eager
                  manner, my dear mother, when <pb n="254" facs="pageImages/254.jpg"/>his mind is
                  interested. "Catherine," said he, "I am going home to-day; I am sorry to leave
                  you, but I must go: it is a great while since I have seen my father and mother. I
                  am going to send James forward with my hunters immediately; if you have any
                  letter, therefore, he can take it. I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or
                  Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I have business; but before I leave
                  you," he continued, speaking in a lower tone, and with still greater energy, "I
                  must warn you of one thing—do not let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that
                  Martin. He wants to marry her; her mother promotes the match, but she cannot
                  endure the idea of it. Be assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the
                  truth of what I say; I know that Frederica is made wretched by Sir James's
                  continuing here. She is a sweet girl, and deserves a better fate. Send him away
                  immediately; he is only a fool: but what her mother can mean, Heaven only knows!
                  Good bye," he added, shaking my hand with earnestness; "I do not know when you
                  will see me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you MUST make it
                  your business to see justice done her. She is an<ref target="aAmiable"

                  what we have given her credit for." He then left me, and ran upstairs. I would not
                  try to stop him, for I know what his feelings must be. The nature of mine, as I
                  listened to him, I need not attempt to describe; for a minute or two I remained in
                  the same spot, overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed; yet it
                  required some consideration to be tranquilly <pb n="255" facs="pageImages/255.jpg"
                  />happy. In about ten minutes after my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered
                  the room. I concluded, of course, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling; and
                  looked with anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face.
                  Mistress of deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after
                  chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, "I find from Wilson
                  that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy—is it true that he leaves Churchhill this
                  morning?" I replied that it was. "He told us nothing of all this last night," said
                  she, laughing, "or even this morning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it
                  himself. Young men are often hasty in their resolutions, and not more sudden in
                  forming than unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to
                  change his mind at last, and not go." She soon afterwards left the room. I trust,
                  however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear an alteration of his
                  present plan; things have gone too far. They must have quarrelled, and about
                  Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me. What delight will be yours in seeing
                  him again; in seeing him still worthy your esteem, still capable of forming your
                  happiness! When I next write I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone,
                  Lady Susan vanquished, and Frederica at peace. We have much to do, but it shall be
                  done. I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change was effected. I
                  finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations. </p>

               <p>Little did I imagine, my dear Mother, when I sent off my last letter, that the
                  delightful perturbation of spirits I was then in would undergo so speedy, so
                  melancholy a reverse. I never can sufficiently regret that I wrote to you at all.
                  Yet who could have foreseen what has happened? My dear mother, every hope which
                  made me so happy only two hours ago has vanished. The quarrel between Lady Susan
                  and Reginald is made up, and we are all as we were before. One point only is
                  gained. Sir James Martin is dismissed. What are we now to look forward to? I am
                  indeed disappointed; Reginald was all but gone,<ref target="aStablehand"

                     take out and saddle the horses if any one in the house they worked for wanted

                     employers.</note>; who would not have felt safe? For half an hour I was in
                  momentary expectation of his departure. After I had sent off my letter to you, I
                  went to Mr. Vernon, and sat with him in his room talking over the whole matter,
                  and then determined to look for Frederica, whom I had not seen since breakfast. I
                  met her on the stairs, and saw that she was crying. "My dear aunt," said she, "he
                  is going—Mr. De Courcy is going, and it is all my fault. I am afraid you will be
                  very angry with me, but indeed I had no idea it would end so." "My love," I
                  replied, "do not think it necessary to apologize to me on that account. I shall
                  feel myself under an obligation to anyone who is the means of sending my brother
                  home, because," <pb n="257 [page breaks after recol-]" facs="pageImages/257.jpg"
                  />recollecting myself, "I know my father wants very much to see him. But what is
                  it you have done to occasion all this?" She blushed deeply as she answered: "I was
                  so unhappy about Sir James that I could not help—I have done something very wrong,
                  I know; but you have not an idea of the misery I have been in: and mamma had
                  ordered me never to speak to you or my uncle about it, and—" "You therefore spoke
                  to my brother to engage his interference," said I, to save her the explanation.
                  "No, but I wrote to him—I did indeed, I got up this morning <ref target="aLight"

                     was the primary source of light, candles and oil lamps were used to light up
                     one's house. These sources when the sun could not be depended on. The use of
                     gas lighting was seen during this period of time but was sparsely used due to
                     the daily set up of the gas for the light (<ref

                  never should have courage to give it. After breakfast however, as I was going to
                  my room, I met him in the passage, and then, as I knew that everything must depend
                  on that moment, I forced myself to give it. He was so good as to take it
                  immediately. I dared not look at him, and ran away directly. I was in such a
                  fright I could hardly breathe. My dear aunt, you do not know how miserable I have
                  been." "Frederica" said I, "you ought to have told me all your distresses. You
                  would have found in me a friend always ready to assist you. Do you think that your
                  uncle or I should not have espoused your cause as warmly as my brother?" "Indeed,
                  I did not doubt your kindness," said she, colouring again, "but I thought Mr. De
                  Courcy could do anything with my mother; but I was mistaken: they have had a
                  dreadful quarrel about it, and he is going away. Mamma will never forgive me, and
                  I shall be worse off than ever." "No, you shall not," I replied; "in such a point
                  as this your <pb n="258" facs="pageImages/258.jpg"/>mother's prohibition ought not
                  to have prevented your speaking to me on the subject. She has no right to make you
                  unhappy, and she shall NOT do it. Your applying, however, to Reginald can be
                  productive only of good to all parties. I believe it is best as it is. Depend upon
                  it that you shall not be made unhappy any longer." At that moment how great was my
                  astonishment at seeing Reginald come out of Lady Susan's dressing-room. My heart
                  misgave me instantly. His confusion at seeing me was very evident. Frederica
                  immediately disappeared. "Are you going?" I said; "you will find Mr. Vernon in his
                  own room." "No, Catherine," he replied, "I am not going. Will you let me speak to
                  you a moment?" We went into my room. "I find," he continued, his confusion
                  increasing as he spoke, "that I have been acting with my usual foolish
                  impetuosity. I have entirely misunderstood Lady Susan, and was on the point of
                  leaving the house under a false impression of her conduct. There has been some
                  very great mistake; we have been all mistaken, I fancy. Frederica does not know
                  her mother. Lady Susan means nothing but her good, but she will not make a friend
                  of her. Lady Susan does not always know, therefore, what will make her daughter
                  happy. Besides, I could have no right to interfere. Miss Vernon was mistaken in
                  applying to me. In short, Catherine, everything has gone wrong, but it is now all
                  happily settled. Lady Susan, I believe, wishes to speak to you about it, if you
                  are at leisure." "Certainly," I replied, deeply sighing at the recital of so lame
                  a story. I <pb n="259" facs="pageImages/259.jpg"/>made no comments, however, for
                  words would have been vain. </p>
               <p>Reginald was glad to get away, and I went to Lady Susan, curious, indeed, to hear
                  her account of it. "Did I not tell you," said she with a smile, "that your brother
                  would not leave us after all?" "You did, indeed," replied I very gravely; "but I
                  flattered myself you would be mistaken." "I should not have hazarded such an
                  opinion," returned she, "if it had not at that moment occurred to me that his
                  resolution of going might be occasioned by a conversation in which we had been
                  this morning engaged, and which had ended very much to his dissatisfaction, from
                  our not rightly understanding each other's meaning. This idea struck me at the
                  moment, and I instantly determined that an accidental dispute, in which I might
                  probably be as much to blame as himself, should not deprive you of your brother.
                  If you remember, I left the room almost immediately. I was resolved to lose no
                  time in clearing up those mistakes as far as I could. The case was this—Frederica
                  had set herself violently against marrying Sir James." "And can your ladyship
                  wonder that she should?" cried I with some warmth; "Frederica has an excellent
                  understanding, and Sir James has none." "I am at least very far from regretting
                  it, my dear sister," said she; "on the contrary, I am grateful for so favourable a
                  sign of my daughter's sense. Sir James is certainly below par (his boyish manners
                  make him appear worse); and had Frederica possessed the penetration and the
                  abilities which I could have wished in my daughter, <pb n="260"
                     facs="pageImages/260.jpg"/>or had I even known her to possess as much as she
                  does, I should not have been anxious for the match." "It is odd that you should
                  alone be ignorant of your daughter's sense!" "Frederica never does justice to
                  herself; her manners are shy and childish, and besides she is afraid of me. During
                  her poor father's life she was a spoilt child; the severity which it has since
                  been necessary for me to show has alienated her affection; neither has she any of
                  that brilliancy of intellect, that genius or vigour of mind which will force
                  itself forward." "Say rather that she has been <ref

                  my dearest Mrs. Vernon, how fully I am aware of that; but I would wish to forget
                  every circumstance that might throw blame on the memory of one whose name is
                  sacred with me." Here she pretended to cry; I was out of patience with her. "But
                  what," said I, "was your ladyship going to tell me about your disagreement with my
                  brother?" "It originated in an action of my daughter's, which equally marks her
                  want of judgment and the unfortunate dread of me I have been mentioning—she wrote

                  or to me on the cause of her distress; what could she do, therefore, but apply to
                  my brother?" "Good God!" she exclaimed, "what an opinion you must have of me! Can
                  you possibly suppose that I was aware of her unhappiness! that it was my object to
                  make my own child miserable, and that I had forbidden her speaking to you on the
                  subject from a fear of your interrupting the diabolical scheme? Do you <pb n="261"

                  my first earthly duty to promote? The idea is horrible!" "What, then, was your
                  intention when you insisted on her silence?" "Of what use, my dear sister, could
                  be any application to you, however the affair might stand? Why should I subject
                  you to entreaties which I refused to attend to myself? Neither for your sake nor
                  for hers, nor for my own, could such a thing be desirable. When my own resolution
                  was taken I could not wish for the interference, however friendly, of another
                  person. I was mistaken, it is true, but I believed myself right." "But what was
                  this mistake to which <pb n="262" facs="pageImages/262.jpg"/>your ladyship so
                  often alludes! from whence arose so astonishing a misconception of your daughter's
                  feelings! Did you not know that she disliked Sir James?" "I knew that he was not
                  absolutely the man she would have chosen, but I was persuaded that her objections
                  to him did not arise from any perception of his deficiency. You must not question
                  me, however, my dear sister, too minutely on this point," continued she, taking me
                  affectionately by the hand; "I honestly own that there is something to conceal.
                  Frederica makes me very unhappy! Her applying to Mr. De Courcy hurt me
                  particularly." "What is it you mean to infer," said I, "by this appearance of
                  mystery? If you think your daughter at all attached to Reginald, her objecting to
                  Sir James could not less deserve to be attended to than if the cause of her
                  objecting had been a consciousness of his folly; and why should your ladyship, at
                  any rate, quarrel with my brother for an interference which, you must know, it is
                  not in his nature to refuse when urged in such a manner?" </p>

                  other: he believed me more to blame than I really was; I considered his
                  interference less excusable than I now find it. I have a real regard for him, and
                  was beyond expression mortified to find it, as I thought, so ill bestowed. We were
                  both warm, and of course both to blame. His resolution of leaving Churchhill is
                  consistent with his general eagerness. When I understood his intention, however,
                  and at the same time began to think that we had been perhaps equally mistaken in
                  each other's meaning, I resolved to have an explanation before it was too late.
                  For any member of your family I must always feel a degree of affection, and I own
                  it would have sensibly hurt me if my acquaintance with Mr. De Courcy had ended so
                  gloomily. I have now only to say further, that as I am convinced of Frederica's
                  having a reasonable dislike to Sir James, I shall instantly inform him that he
                  must give up all hope of her. I reproach myself for having, even though
                  innocently, made her unhappy on that score. She shall have all the retribution in
                  my power to make; if she value her own happiness as much as I do, if she judge
                  wisely, and command herself as she ought, she may now be easy. Excuse me, my
                  dearest sister, for thus trespassing on your time, but I owe it <pb n="263"
                     facs="pageImages/263.jpg"/>to my own character; and after this explanation I
                  trust I am in no danger of sinking in your opinion." I could have said, "Not much,
                  indeed!" but I left her almost in silence. It was the greatest stretch of
                  forbearance I could practise. I could not have stopped myself had I begun. Her
                  assurance! her deceit! but I will not allow myself to dwell on them; they will
                  strike you sufficiently. My heart sickens within me. As soon as I was tolerably
                  composed I returned to the parlour. Sir James's carriage was at the door, and he,
                  merry as usual, soon afterwards took his leave. How easily does her ladyship
                  encourage or dismiss a lover! In spite of this release, Frederica still looks
                  unhappy: still fearful, perhaps, of her mother's anger; and though dreading my
                  brother's departure, jealous, it may be, of his staying. I see how closely she
                  observes him and Lady Susan, poor girl! I have now no hope for her. There is not a
                  chance of her affection being returned. He thinks very differently of her from
                  what he used to do; he does her some justice, but his reconciliation with her
                  mother precludes every dearer hope. Prepare, my dear mother, for the worst! The
                  probability of their marrying is surely heightened! He is more securely hers than
                  ever. When that wretched event takes place, Frederica must belong wholly to us. I
                  am thankful that <ref target="aLastLetter" corresp="nLastLetter">my last letter

               <opener><dateline><placeName>Churchhill.</placeName></dateline></opener>

               <p>I call on you, dear Alicia, for congratulations: I am my own self, gay and
                  triumphant! When I wrote to you the other day I was, in truth, in high irritation,
                  and with ample cause. Nay, I know not whether I ought to be quite tranquil now,
                  for I have had more trouble in restoring peace than I ever intended to submit to—a
                  spirit, too, resulting from a fancied sense of superior integrity, which is
                  peculiarly insolent! I shall not easily forgive him, I assure you. He was actually
                  on the point of leaving Churchhill! I had scarcely concluded my last, when Wilson
                  brought me word of it. I found, therefore, that something must be done; for I did
                  not choose to leave my character at the mercy of a man whose passions are so
                  violent and so revengeful. It would have been trifling with my reputation to allow
                  of his departing with such an impression in my disfavour; in this light,
                  condescension was necessary. I sent Wilson to say that I desired to speak with him
                  before he went; he came immediately. The angry emotions which had marked every
                  feature when we last parted were partially subdued. He seemed astonished at the
                  summons, and looked as if half wishing and half fearing to be softened by what I
                  might say. If my countenance expressed what I aimed at, it was composed and
                  dignified; and yet, with a degree of pensiveness which might convince him that I
                  was not <pb n="265" facs="pageImages/265.jpg"/>quite happy. "I beg your pardon,
                  sir, for the liberty I have taken in sending for you," said I; "but as I have just
                  learnt your intention of leaving this place to-day, I feel it my duty to entreat
                  that you will not on my account shorten your visit here even an hour. I am
                  perfectly aware that after what has passed between us it would ill suit the
                  feelings of either to remain longer in the same house: so very great, so total a
                  change from the intimacy of friendship must render any future intercourse the
                  severest punishment; and your resolution of quitting Churchhill is undoubtedly in
                  unison with our situation, and with those lively feelings which I know you to
                  possess. But, at the same time, it is not for me to suffer such a sacrifice as it
                  must be to leave relations to whom you are so much attached, and are so dear. My
                  remaining here cannot give that pleasure to Mr. and Mrs. Vernon which your society
                  must; and my visit has already perhaps been too long. My removal, therefore, which
                  must, at any rate, take place soon, may, with perfect convenience, be hastened;
                  and I make it my particular request that I may not in any way be instrumental in
                  separating a family so affectionately attached to each other. Where I go is of no
                  consequence to anyone; of very little to myself; but you are of importance to all
                  your connections." Here I concluded, and I hope you will be satisfied with my
                  speech. Its effect on Reginald justifies some portion of vanity, for it was no
                  less favourable than instantaneous. Oh, how delightful it was to watch the
                  variations of his countenance while I spoke! to see the struggle between <pb
                     n="266 [page breaks after be-]" facs="pageImages/266.jpg"/>returning tenderness
                  and the remains of displeasure. There is something agreeable in feelings so easily
                  worked on; not that I envy him their possession, nor would, for the world, have
                  such myself; but they are very convenient when one wishes to influence the
                  passions of another. And yet this Reginald, whom a very few words from me softened
                  at once into the utmost submission, and rendered more tractable, more attached,
                  more devoted than ever, would have left me in the first angry swelling of his
                  proud heart without deigning to seek an explanation. Humbled as he now is, I
                  cannot forgive him such an instance of pride, and am doubtful whether I ought not
                  to punish him by dismissing him at once after this reconciliation, or by marrying
                  and teazing him for ever. But these measures are each too violent to be adopted
                  without some deliberation; at present my thoughts are fluctuating between various
                  schemes. I have many things to compass: I must punish Frederica, and pretty
                  severely too, for her application to Reginald; I must punish him for receiving it
                  so favourably, and for the rest of his conduct. I must torment my sister-in-law
                  for the insolent triumph of her look and manner since Sir James has been
                  dismissed; for, in reconciling Reginald to me, I was not able to save that
                  ill-fated young man; and I must make myself amends for the humiliation to which I
                  have stooped within these few days. To effect all this I have various plans. I
                  have also an idea of being soon in town; and whatever may be my determination as
                  to the rest, I shall probably put THAT <pb n="267" facs="pageImages/267.jpg"
                  />project in execution; for London will be always the fairest field of action,
                  however my views may be directed; and at any rate I shall there be rewarded by
                  your society, and a little dissipation, for a ten weeks' penance at Churchhill. I
                  believe I owe it to my character to complete the match between my daughter and Sir
                  James after having so long intended it. Let me know your opinion on this point.
                  Flexibility of mind, a disposition easily biassed by others, is an attribute which
                  you know I am not very desirous of obtaining; nor has Frederica any claim to the
                  indulgence of her notions at the expense of her mother's inclinations. Her idle
                  love for Reginald, too! It is surely my duty to discourage such romantic nonsense.
                  All things considered, therefore, it seems incumbent on me to take her to town and
                  marry her immediately to Sir James. When my own will is effected contrary to his,
                  I shall have some credit in being on good terms with Reginald, which at present,
                  in fact, I have not; for though he is still in my power, I have given up the very
                  article by which our quarrel was produced, and at best the honour of victory is
                  doubtful. Send me your opinion on all these matters, my dear Alicia, and let me
                  know whether you can get lodgings to suit me within a short distance of you. </p>

               <p>I am gratified by your reference, and this is my advice: that you come to town
                  yourself, without loss of time, but that you leave Frederica behind. It would
                  surely be much more to the purpose to get yourself well established by marrying
                  Mr. De Courcy, than to irritate him and the rest of his family by making her marry
                  Sir James. You should think more of yourself and less of your daughter. She is not
                  of a disposition to do you credit in the world, and seems precisely in her proper
                  place at Churchhill, with the Vernons. But you are fitted for society, and it is
                  shameful to have you exiled from it. Leave Frederica, therefore, to punish herself
                  for the plague she has given you, by indulging that romantic<ref target="aTender"

                  enough, and come to London as soon as you can. I have another reason for urging
                  this: Mainwaring came to town last week, and has contrived, in spite of Mr.
                  Johnson, to make opportunities of seeing me. He is absolutely miserable about you,
                  and jealous to such a degree of De Courcy that it would be highly unadvisable for
                  them to meet at present. And yet, if you do not allow him to see you here, I
                  cannot answer for his not committing some great imprudence—such as going to
                  Churchhill, for instance, which would be dreadful! Besides, if you take my advice,
                  and resolve to marry <pb n="269" facs="pageImages/269.jpg"/>De Courcy, it will be
                  indispensably necessary to you to get Mainwaring out of the way; and you only can
                  have influence enough to send him back to his wife. I have still another motive
                  for your coming: Mr. Johnson leaves London next Tuesday; he is going for his
                  health to <ref target="aBath" corresp="nBath">Bath</ref><note xml:id="nBath"

                     Mrs. Johnson lives. "Upper Seymour Street is situated in Marylebone...just
                     around the corner from Portman Square and one block over from Upper Berkeley

               <p>This letter, my dear Mother, will be brought you by Reginald. His long visit is
                  about to be concluded at last, but I fear the separation takes place too late to
                  do us any good. She is going to London to see her particular friend, Mrs. Johnson.
                  It was at first her intention that Frederica should accompany her, for the benefit
                  of masters, but we overruled her there. Frederica was wretched in the idea of
                  going, and I could not bear to have her at the mercy of her mother; not all the
                  masters in London could compensate for the ruin of her comfort. I should have
                  feared, too, for her health, and for everything but her principles—there I believe
                  she is not to be injured by her mother, or her mother's friends; but with those
                  friends she must have mixed (a very bad set, I doubt not), or have been left in
                  total solitude, and I can hardly tell which would have been worse for her. If she
                  is with her mother, moreover, she must, alas! in all probability be with Reginald,
                  and that would be the greatest evil of all. Here we shall in time be in peace, and
                  our regular employments, our books and conversations, with exercise, the children,
                  and every domestic pleasure in my power to procure her, will, I trust, gradually
                  overcome this youthful attachment. I should not have a doubt of it were she
                  slighted for any other woman in the world than her own mother. How long Lady Susan
                     <pb n="271" facs="pageImages/271.jpg"/>will be in town, or whether she returns
                  here again, I know not. I could not be cordial in my invitation, but if she chuses
                  to come no want of cordiality on my part will keep her away. I could not help
                  asking Reginald if he intended being in London this winter, as soon as I found her
                  ladyship's steps would be bent thither; and though he professed himself quite
                  undetermined, there was something in his look and voice as he spoke which
                  contradicted his words. I have done with lamentation; I look upon the event as so
                  far decided that I resign myself to it in despair. If he leaves you soon for
                  London everything will be concluded. </p>

               <p> I write in the greatest distress; the most unfortunate event has just taken
                  place. Mr. Johnson has hit on the most effectual manner of plaguing us all. He had
                  heard, I imagine, by some means or other, that you were soon to be in London, and
                  immediately contrived to have such an attack of the gout as must at least delay
                  his journey to Bath, if not wholly prevent it. I am persuaded the gout is brought
                  on or kept off at pleasure; it was the same when I wanted to join the Hamiltons to
                  the Lakes; and three years ago, when I had a fancy for Bath, nothing could induce
                  him to have a gouty symptom. </p>
               <pb n="272" facs="pageImages/272.jpg"/>
               <p>I am pleased to find that my letter had so much effect on you, and that De Courcy
                  is certainly your own. Let me hear from you as soon as you arrive, and in
                  particular tell me what you mean to do with Mainwaring. It is impossible to say
                  when I shall be able to come to you; my confinement must be great. It is such an
                  abominable trick to be ill here instead of at Bath that I can scarcely command
                  myself at all. At Bath his old aunts would have nursed him, but here it all falls
                  upon me; and he bears pain with such patience that I have not the common excuse
                  for losing my temper. </p>

                  <salute>My dear Alicia,—</salute></opener>
               <p>There needed not this last fit of the gout to make me detest Mr. Johnson, but now
                  the extent of my aversion is not to be estimated. To have you confined as nurse in
                  his apartment! My dear Alicia, of what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man
                  of his age! just old enough to be formal, ungovernable, and to have the gout; too
                  old to be agreeable, too young to die. I arrived last night about five, had
                  scarcely swallowed my dinner when Mainwaring made his appearance. I will not
                  dissemble what real pleasure his sight afforded me, nor how strongly I felt the
                  contrast between his person <pb n="273" facs="pageImages/273.jpg"/>and manners and
                  those of Reginald, to the infinite disadvantage of the latter. For an hour or two
                  I was even staggered in my resolution of marrying him, and though this was too
                  idle and nonsensical an idea to remain long on my mind, I do not feel very eager
                  for the conclusion of my marriage, nor look forward with much impatience to the
                  time when Reginald, according to our agreement, is to be in town. I shall probably
                  put off his arrival under some pretence or other. He must not come till Mainwaring
                  is gone. I am still doubtful at times as to marrying; if the old man would die I
                  might not hesitate, but a state of dependance on the caprice of Sir Reginald will
                  not suit the freedom of my spirit; and if I resolve to wait for that event, I
                  shall have excuse enough at present in having been scarcely ten months a widow. I
                  have not given Mainwaring any hint of my intention, or allowed him to consider my
                  acquaintance with Reginald as more than the commonest flirtation, and he is
                  tolerably appeased. Adieu, till we meet; I am enchanted with my lodgings. </p>

                           her fashionable lodgings in Upper Seymour Street. According to the
                           well-researched blog _Jane Austen's World, "living at this location off
                           Oxford Street was considered a moderately respectable to fairly good
                           address during the Regency era." It is located in Westminster next to
                           Hyde Park. </note></placeName></dateline></opener>

               <p>I have received your letter, and though I do not attempt to conceal that I am
                  gratified by your impatience for the hour of meeting, I yet feel myself <pb
                     n="274" facs="pageImages/274.jpg"/>under the necessity of delaying that hour
                  beyond the time originally fixed. Do not think me unkind for such an exercise of
                  my power, nor accuse me of instability without first hearing my reasons. In the
                  course of my journey from Churchhill I had ample leisure for reflection on the
                  present state of our affairs, and every review has served to convince me that they
                  require a delicacy and cautiousness of conduct to which we have hitherto been too
                  little attentive. We have been hurried on by our feelings to a degree of
                  precipitation which ill accords with the claims of our friends or the opinion of
                  the world. We have been unguarded in forming this hasty engagement, but we must
                  not complete the imprudence by ratifying it while there is so much reason to fear
                  the connection would be opposed by those friends on whom you depend. It is not for
                  us to blame any expectations on your father's side of your marrying to advantage;
                  where possessions are so extensive as those of your family, the wish of increasing
                  them, if not strictly reasonable, is too common to excite surprize or resentment.
                  He has a right to require; a woman of fortune in his daughter-in-law, and I am
                  sometimes quarrelling with myself for suffering you to form a connection so
                  imprudent; but the influence of reason is often acknowledged too late by those who
                  feel like me. I have now been but a few months a widow, and, however little
                  indebted to my husband's memory for any happiness derived from him during a union
                  of some years, I cannot forget that the indelicacy of so early a second marriage
                  must subject me to the censure of the world, and incur, <pb n="275"
                     facs="pageImages/275.jpg"/>what would be still more insupportable, the
                  displeasure of Mr. Vernon. I might perhaps harden myself in time against the
                  injustice of general reproach, but the loss of HIS valued esteem I am, as you well
                  know, ill-fitted to endure; and when to this may be added the consciousness of
                  having injured you with your family, how am I to support myself? With feelings so
                  poignant as mine, the conviction of having divided the son from his parents would
                  make me, even with you, the most miserable of beings. It will surely, therefore,
                  be advisable to delay our union—to delay it till appearances are more
                  promising—till affairs have taken a more favourable turn. To assist us in such a
                  resolution I feel that absence will be necessary. We must not meet. Cruel as this
                  sentence may appear, the necessity of pronouncing it, which can alone reconcile it
                  to myself, will be evident to you when you have considered our situation in the
                  light in which I have found myself imperiously obliged to place it. You may be—you
                  must be—well assured that nothing but the strongest conviction of duty could
                  induce me to wound my own feelings by urging a lengthened separation, and of
                  insensibility to yours you will hardly suspect me. Again, therefore, I say that we
                  ought not, we must not, yet meet. By a removal for some months from each other we
                  shall tranquillise the sisterly fears of Mrs. Vernon, who, accustomed herself to
                  the enjoyment of riches, considers fortune as necessary everywhere, and whose
                  sensibilities are not of a nature to comprehend ours. Let me hear from you
                  soon—very soon. Tell me that you submit to my <pb n="276"
                     facs="pageImages/276.jpg"/>arguments, and do not reproach me for using such. I
                  cannot bear reproaches: my spirits are not so high as to need being repressed. I
                  must endeavour to seek amusement, and fortunately many of my friends are in town;
                  amongst them the Mainwarings; you know how sincerely I regard both husband and
                  wife. </p>

                  keep him longer in the country, has hastened him to town. Much as I wish him away,
                  however, I cannot help being pleased with such a proof of attachment. He is
                  devoted to me, heart and soul. He will carry this note himself, which is to serve
                  as an introduction to you, with whom he longs to be acquainted. Allow him to spend
                  the evening with you, that I may be in no danger of his returning here. I have
                  told him that I am not quite well, and must be alone; and should he call again
                  there might be confusion, for it is impossible to be sure of servants. Keep him,
                  therefore, I entreat you, in Edward Street. You will not find him a heavy
                  companion, and I allow you to flirt with him as much as you like. At the same
                  time, do not forget my real interest; say all that you can to convince him that I
                  shall be quite wretched if he remains <pb n="277" facs="pageImages/277.jpg"/>here;
                  you know my reasons—propriety, and so forth. I would urge them more myself, but
                  that I am impatient to be rid of him, as Mainwaring comes within half an hour.

               <p> I am in agonies, and know not what to do. Mr. De Courcy arrived just when he
                  should not. Mrs. Mainwaring had that instant entered the house, and forced herself
                  into her guardian's presence, though I did not know a syllable of it till
                  afterwards, for I was out when both she and Reginald came, or I should have sent
                  him away at all events; but she was shut up with Mr. Johnson, while he waited in
                  the drawing-room for me. She arrived yesterday in pursuit of her husband, but
                  perhaps you know this already from himself. She came to this house to entreat my
                  husband's interference, and before I could be aware of it, everything that you
                  could wish to be concealed was known to him, and unluckily she had wormed out of
                  Mainwaring's servant that he had visited you every day since your being in town,
                  and had just watched him to your door herself! What could I do! Facts are such
                  horrid things! All is by this time known to De Courcy, who is now alone with Mr.
                  Johnson. Do not accuse me; indeed, it was impossible to prevent it. Mr. Johnson
                  has for some time <pb n="278" facs="pageImages/278.jpg"/>suspected De Courcy of
                  intending to marry you, and would speak with him alone as soon as he knew him to
                  be in the house. That detestable Mrs. Mainwaring, who, for your comfort, has
                  fretted herself thinner and uglier than ever, is still here, and they have been
                  all closeted together. What can be done? At any rate, I hope he will plague his
                  wife more than ever.</p>

               <p>I write only to bid you farewell, the spell is removed; I see you as you are.
                  Since we parted yesterday, I have received from indisputable authority such a
                  history of you as must bring the most mortifying conviction of the imposition I
                  have been under, and the absolute necessity of an immediate and eternal separation
                  from you. You cannot doubt to what I allude. Langford! Langford! that word will be
                  sufficient. I received my information in Mr. Johnson's house, from Mrs. Mainwaring
                  herself. You know how I have loved you; you can intimately judge of my present
                  feelings, but I am not so weak as to find indulgence in describing them to a woman
                  who will glory in having excited their anguish, but whose affection they have
                  never been able to gain. </p>

               <p>I will not attempt to describe my astonishment in reading the note this moment
                  received from you. I am bewildered in my endeavours to form some rational
                  conjecture of what Mrs. Mainwaring can have told you to occasion so extraordinary
                  a change in your sentiments. Have I not explained everything to you <pb n="280"
                     facs="pageImages/280.jpg"/>with respect to myself which could bear a doubtful
                  meaning, and which the ill-nature of the world had interpreted to my discredit?
                  What can you now have heard to stagger your esteem for me? Have I ever had a
                  concealment from you? Reginald, you agitate me beyond expression, I cannot suppose
                  that the old story of Mrs. Mainwaring's jealousy can be revived again, or at least
                  be <hi rend="italic">listened</hi> to again. Come to me immediately, and explain
                  what is at present absolutely incomprehensible. Believe me the single word of
                  Langford is not of such potent intelligence as to supersede the necessity of more.
                  If we ARE to part, it will at least be handsome to take your personal leave—but I
                  have little heart to jest; in truth, I am serious enough; for to be sunk, though
                  but for an hour, in your esteem is a humiliation to which I know not how to
                  submit. I shall count every minute till your arrival. </p>

                  continues to exist, between you and the man whose family you robbed of its peace
                  in return for the hospitality with which you were received into it; that you have
                  corresponded with him ever since your leaving Langford; not with his wife, but
                  with him, and that he now visits you every day. Can you, dare you deny it? and all
                  this at the time when I was an encouraged, an accepted lover! From what have I not
                  escaped! I have only to be grateful. Far from me be all complaint, every sigh of
                  regret. My own folly had endangered me, my preservation I owe to the kindness, the
                  integrity of another; but the unfortunate Mrs. Mainwaring, whose agonies while she
                  related the past seemed to threaten her reason, how is <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
                  to be consoled! After such a discovery as this, you will scarcely affect further
                  wonder at my meaning in bidding you adieu. My understanding is at length restored,
                  and teaches no less to abhor the artifices which had subdued me than to despise

               <p>I am grieved, though I cannot be astonished at your rupture with Mr. De Courcy; he
                  has just informed Mr. Johnson of it by letter. He leaves London, he says, to-day.
                  Be assured that I partake in all your feelings, and do not be angry if I say that
                  our intercourse, even by letter, must soon be given up. It makes me miserable; but
                  Mr. Johnson vows that if I persist in the connection, he will settle in the
                  country for the rest of his life, and you know it is impossible to submit to such
                  an extremity while any other alternative remains. You have heard of course <pb
                     n="283" facs="pageImages/283.jpg"/>that the Mainwarings are to part, and I am
                  afraid Mrs. M. will come home to us again; but she is still so fond of her
                  husband, and frets so much about him, that perhaps she may not live long. Miss
                  Mainwaring is just come to town to be with her aunt, and they say that she
                  declares she will have Sir James Martin before she leaves London again. If I were
                  you, I would certainly get him myself. I had almost forgot to give you my opinion
                  of Mr. De Courcy; I am really delighted with him; he is full as handsome, I think,
                  as Mainwaring, and with such an open, good-humoured countenance, that one cannot
                  help loving him at first sight. Mr. Johnson and he are the greatest friends in the
                  world. Adieu, my dearest Susan, I wish matters did not go so perversely. That
                  unlucky visit to Langford! but I dare say you did all for the best, and there is
                  no defying destiny. </p>

               <p>I yield to the necessity which parts us. Under circumstances you could not act
                  otherwise. Our friendship cannot be impaired by it, and in happier times, when
                  your situation is as independent as mine, it will unite us again in the same
                  intimacy as ever. For this I shall impatiently wait, and meanwhile can safely
                  assure you that I never was <pb n="284" facs="pageImages/284.jpg"/>more at ease,
                  or better satisfied with myself and everything about me than at the present hour.
                  Your husband I abhor, Reginald I despise, and I am secure of never seeing either
                  again. Have I not reason to rejoice? Mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever;
                  and were we at liberty, I doubt if I could resist even matrimony offered by HIM.
                  This event, if his wife live with you, it may be in your power to hasten. The
                  violence of her feelings, which must wear her out, may be easily kept in
                  irritation. I rely on your friendship for this. I am now satisfied that I never
                  could have brought myself to marry Reginald, and am equally determined that
                  Frederica never shall. To-morrow, I shall fetch her from Churchhill, and let Maria
                  Mainwaring tremble for the consequence. Frederica shall be Sir James's wife before
                  she quits my house, and she may whimper, and the Vernons may storm, I regard them
                  not. I am tired of submitting my will to the caprices of others; of resigning my
                  own judgment in deference to those to whom I owe no duty, and for whom I feel no
                  respect. I have given up too much, have been too easily worked on, but Frederica
                  shall now feel the difference. Adieu, dearest of friends; may the next gouty
                  attack be more favourable! and may you always regard me as unalterably yours, </p>

                  questions, but I hope we shall soon know all. This is the most joyful hour he has
                  ever given us since the day of his birth. Nothing is wanting but to have you here,
                  and it is our particular wish and entreaty that you would come to us as soon as
                  you can. You have owed us a visit many long weeks; I hope nothing will make it

                  niece is included, of course; I long to see her. It has been a sad, heavy winter

                  season so dreary before; but this happy meeting will make us young again.
                  Frederica runs much in my thoughts, and when Reginald has recovered his usual good
                  spirits (as I trust he soon will) we will try to rob him of his heart once more,
                  and I am full of hopes of seeing their hands joined at no great distance. </p>

                  surprize is the greater because on Wednesday, the very day of his coming to
                  Parklands, we had a most unexpected and unwelcome visit from Lady Susan, looking
                  all cheerfulness and good-humour, and seeming more as if she were to marry him
                  when she got to London than as if parted from him for ever. She stayed nearly two
                  hours, was as affectionate and agreeable as ever, and not a syllable, not a hint
                  was dropped, of any disagreement or coolness between them. I asked her whether she

                  thoroughly unwilling to let her go, and so was her uncle; and all that could be
                  urged we did urge; but Lady Susan declared that as she was now about to fix

                  I wish I could think so too. The poor girl's heart was almost broke at taking
                  leave of us. I charged her to write to me very often, and to remember that if she
                  were in any distress we should be always her friends. I took care to see her
                  alone, that I might say all this, and I hope made her a little more comfortable;
                  but I shall not be easy till I can go to town and judge of her situation myself. I

               <p>This correspondence, by a meeting between some of the parties, and a separation
                  between the others, could not, to the great detriment of the Post Office revenue,
                  be continued any longer. Very little <pb n="288 [page breaks after assist-]"
                     facs="pageImages/288.jpg"/>assistance to the State could be derived from the
                  epistolary intercourse of Mrs. Vernon and her niece; for the former soon
                  perceived, by the style of Frederica's letters, that they were written under her
                  mother's inspection! and therefore, deferring all particular enquiry till she
                  could make it personally in London, ceased writing minutely or often. Having
                  learnt enough, in the meanwhile, from her open-hearted brother, of what had passed
                  between him and Lady Susan to sink the latter lower than ever in her opinion, she
                  was proportionably more anxious to get Frederica removed from such a mother, and
                  placed under her own care; and, though with little hope of success, was resolved
                  to leave nothing unattempted that might offer a chance of obtaining her
                  sister-in-law's consent to it. Her anxiety on the subject made her press for an
                  early visit to London; and Mr. Vernon, who, as it must already have appeared,
                  lived only to do whatever he was desired, soon found some accommodating business
                  to call him thither. With a heart full of the matter, Mrs. Vernon waited on Lady
                  Susan shortly after her arrival in town, and was met with such an easy and
                  cheerful affection, as made her almost turn from her with horror. No remembrance
                  of Reginald, no consciousness of guilt, gave one look of embarrassment; she was in
                  excellent spirits, and seemed eager to show at once by ever possible attention to
                  her brother and sister her sense of their kindness, and her pleasure in their
                  society. Frederica was no more altered than Lady Susan; the same restrained
                  manners, the same timid look in the presence of her mother as heretofore, <pb
                     n="289" facs="pageImages/289.jpg"/>assured her aunt of her situation being
                  uncomfortable, and confirmed her in the plan of altering it. No unkindness,
                  however, on the part of Lady Susan appeared. Persecution on the subject of Sir
                  James was entirely at an end; his name merely mentioned to say that he was not in
                  London; and indeed, in all her conversation, she was solicitous only for the
                  welfare and improvement of her daughter, acknowledging, in terms of grateful
                  delight, that Frederica was now growing every day more and more what a parent
                  could desire. Mrs. Vernon, surprized and incredulous, knew not what to suspect,
                  and, without any change in her own views, only feared greater difficulty in
                  accomplishing them. The first hope of anything better was derived from Lady
                  Susan's asking her whether she thought Frederica looked quite as well as she had
                  done at Churchhill, as she must confess herself to have sometimes an anxious doubt
                  of London's perfectly agreeing with her. Mrs. Vernon, encouraging the doubt,
                  directly proposed her niece's returning with them into the country. Lady Susan was
                  unable to express her sense of such kindness, yet knew not, from a variety of
                  reasons, how to part with her daughter; and as, though her own plans were not yet
                  wholly fixed, she trusted it would ere long be in her power to take Frederica into
                  the country herself, concluded by declining entirely to profit by such unexampled
                  attention. Mrs. Vernon persevered, however, in the offer of it, and though Lady
                  Susan continued to resist, her resistance in the course of a few days seemed
                  somewhat less formidable. The <pb n="290" facs="pageImages/290.jpg"/>lucky alarm

                     >DRAFT-QUOTATION PROBLEMS AND C18 CONTEXT According to History.com the flu, or
                     influenza, is a highly contagious viral infection that mainly affects the
                     respiratory system. During the 18th century another influenza pandemic arose.
                     It began in 1729 in Russia and spread throughout Europe within 6 months and all
                     the world within three years. This was a disease that affected a lot of people
                     and could be compared to COVID-19 today (<ref
                        target="https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/flu"

                  soon. Lady Susan's maternal fears were then too much awakened for her to think of
                  anything but Frederica's removal from the risk of infection; above all disorders
                  in the world she most dreaded the influenza for her daughter's constitution! </p>
               <p>Frederica returned to Churchhill with her uncle and aunt; and three weeks
                  afterwards, Lady Susan announced her being married to Sir James Martin. Mrs.
                  Vernon was then convinced of what she had only suspected before, that she might
                  have spared herself all the trouble of urging a removal which Lady Susan had
                  doubtless resolved on from the first. Frederica's visit was nominally for six
                  weeks, but her mother, though inviting her to return in one or two affectionate
                  letters, was very ready to oblige the whole party by consenting to a prolongation
                  of her stay, and in the course of two months ceased to write of her absence, and
                  in the course of two or more to write to her at all. Frederica was therefore fixed
                  in the family of her uncle and aunt till such time as Reginald De Courcy could be
                  talked, flattered, and finessed into an affection for her which, allowing leisure
                  for the conquest of his attachment to her mother, for his abjuring all future
                  attachments, and detesting the sex, might be reasonably looked for in the course
                  of a twelvemonth. Three months might have done it in general, but Reginald's
                  feelings were no less lasting than lively. Whether Lady Susan was or was not happy
                  in her second choice, I do not <pb n="291" facs="pageImages/291.jpg"/>see how it
                  can ever be ascertained; for who would take her assurance of it on either side of
                  the question? The world must judge from probabilities; she had nothing against her
                  but her husband, and her conscience. Sir James may seem to have drawn a harder lot
                  than mere folly merited; I leave him, therefore, to all the pity that anybody can
                  give him. For myself, I confess that I can pity only Miss Mainwaring; who, coming
                  to town, and putting herself to an <ref target="aClothes" corresp="nClothes">an
