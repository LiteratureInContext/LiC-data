               <p> A gentleman and a lady travelling from Tunbridge towards that part of the Sussex
                  coast which lies between Hastings and Eastbourne, being induced by business to
                  quit the high road and attempt a very rough lane, were overturned in toiling up
                  its long a scent, half rock, half sand. The accident happened just beyond the only
                  gentleman's house near the lane—a house which their driver, on being first
                  required to take that direction, had conceived to be necessarily their object and
                  had with most unwilling looks been constrained to pass by. He had grumbled and
                  shaken his shoulders and pitied and cut his horses so sharply that he might have
                  been open to the suspicion of overturning them on purpose (especially as the
                  carriage was not his master's own) if the road had not indisputably become worse
                  than before, as soon as the premises of the said house were left behind—expressing
                  with a most portentous countenance that, beyond it, no wheels but cart wheels
                  could safely proceed. <pb n="[b1-2]"/> The severity of the fall was broken by
                  their slow pace and the narrowness of the lane; and the gentleman having scrambled
                  out and helped out his companion, they neither of them at first felt more than
                  shaken and bruised. But the gentleman had, in the course of the extrication,
                  sprained his foot; and soon becoming sensible of it, was obliged in a few moments
                  to cut short both his remonstrances to the driver and his congratulations to his
                  wife and himself and sit down on the bank, unable to stand. </p>
               <p> "There is something wrong here," said he, putting his hand to his ankle. "But
                  never mind, my dear," looking up at her with a smile, "it could not have happened,
                  you know, in <pb n="[b1-3]"/> a better place Good out of evil. The very thing
                  perhaps to be wished for. We shall soon get relief. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> I
                  fancy, lies my cure," pointing to the neat-looking end of a cottage, which was
                  seen romantically situated among wood on a high eminence at some little distance. </p>
               <p> "Does not <hi rend="italic">that</hi> promise to be the very place?" His wife
                  fervently hoped it was; but stood, terrified and anxious, neither able to do or
                  suggest anything, and receiving her first real comfort from the sight of several
                  persons now coming to their assistance. The accident had been discerned from a
                  hayfield adjoining the house they had passed. And the persons who approached were
                  a well-looking, hale, gentlemanlike man of middle age, the proprietor of the
                  place, who happened to be among his haymakers at the time, and three or four of
                  the ablest of them summoned to attend their master—to say nothing of all the rest
                  of the field, men, women and <pb n="[b1-4]"/> children, not very far off. Mr.
                  Heywood, such was the name of the said proprietor, advanced with a very civil
                  salutation, much concern for the accident, some surprise at anybody's attempting
                  that road in a carriage, and ready offers of assistance. His courtesies were
                  received with good breeding and gratitude, and while one or two of the men lent
                  their help to the driver in getting the carriage upright again, the traveller
                  said, "You are extremely obliging, sir, and I take you at your word— The injury to
                  my leg is, I dare say, very trifling. But it is always best in these cases, you
                  know, to have a surgeon's opinion without loss of time; and as the road does <pb
                     n="[b1-5]"/> not seem in a favourable state for my getting up to his house
                  myself, I will thank you to send off one of these good people for the surgeon."
                  "The surgeon!" exclaimed Mr. Heywood. "I am afraid you will find no surgeon at
                  hand here, but I dare say we shall do very well without him." "Nay sir, if <hi
                     rend="italic">he</hi> is not in the way, his partner will do just as well—or
                  rather better. I would rather see his partner. Indeed I would prefer the
                  attendance of his partner. One of these good people can be with him in three
                  minutes, I am sure. I need not ask whether I see the house," looking towards the
                  cottage, "for excepting your own, we have passed none in this place which can be
                  the abode of a gentleman." Mr. Heywood looked very much astonished. "What, sir!
                  Are you expecting to find a surgeon in that cottage? We have neither surgeon nor
                  partner <pb n="[b1-6]"/> in the parish, I assure you." "Excuse me, sir," replied
                  the other. "I am sorry to have the appearance of contradicting you, but from the
                  extent of the parish or some other cause you may not be aware of the fact—stay—
                  can I be mistaken in the place? Am I not in Willingden? Is not this Willingden?"
                  "Yes, sir, this is certainly Willingden." "Then, sir, I can bring proof of your
                  having a surgeon in the parish, whether you may know it or not. Here, sir," taking
                  out his pocket book, "if you will do me the favor of casting your eye over these
                  advertisements which I cut out myself from the <hi rend="italic">Morning</hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Kentish Gazette</hi> only
                  yesterday morning in London, I think you will be convinced that I am not speaking
                  at random. You will find in it an advertisement of the dissolution of a
                  partnership in the medical line—in your own parish—extensive business—undeniable
                  character—respectable references—wishing to form a separate establishment— </p>
               <pb n="[b1-7]"/>
               <p> you will find it at full length, sir," offering the two little oblong extracts.
                  "Sir, if you were to show me all the newspapers that are printed in one week
                  throughout the kingdom, you would not persuade me of there being a surgeon in
                  Willingden," said Mr. Heywood with a good-humoured smile. "Having lived here ever
                  since I was born, man and boy fifty-seven years, I think I must have known of such
                  a person. At least I may venture to say that he has not much business. To be sure,
                  if gentlemen were to be often attempting this lane in post-chaises, it might not
                  be a bad speculation for a surgeon to get a house at the top of the hill. But as
                  to that cottage, I can assure you, sir, that it is in fact, in spite of its spruce
                  air at this distance, as indifferent a double tenement as any in the parish, and
                  that my shepherd lives at one end and three old women at the other." He took the
                  pieces of paper as he spoke, and, having <pb n="[b1-8]"/> looked them over, added,
                  "I believe I can explain it, sir. Your mistake <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the
                  place. There are two Willingdens in this country. And your advertisements must
                  refer to the other, which is Great Willingden or Willingden Abbots, and lies seven
                  miles off on the other side of Battle. Quite down in the weald. And <hi
                     rend="italic">we,</hi> sir," he added, speaking rather proudly, "are not in the
                  weald." "Not <hi rend="italic">down</hi> in the weald, I am sure," replied the
                  traveller pleasantly. "It took us half an hour to climb your hill. Well, I dare
                  say it is as you say and I have made an abominably stupid blunder. All done in a
                  moment. The advertisements did not catch my eye till the last half hour of our
                  being in town—everything in the hurry and confusion which always attend a short
                  stay there. One is never able to complete anything in the way of business, you
                  know, till the carriage is at the door. So satisfying myself with a brief inquiry,
                  and finding we were actually to pass <pb n="[b1-9]"/> within a mile or two of a
                     <hi rend="italic">Willingden</hi> , I sought no farther....My dear" (to his
                  wife) "I am very sorry to have brought you into this scrape. But do not be alarmed
                  about my leg. It gives me no pain while I am quiet. And as soon as these good
                  people have succeeded in setting the carriage to rights and turning the horses
                  round, the best thing we can do will be to measure back our steps into the
                  turnpike road and proceed to Hailsham, and so home without attempting anything
                  farther. Two hours take us home from Hailsham. And once at home, we have our
                  remedy at hand, you know. A little of our own bracing sea air will soon set me on
                  my feet again. Depend upon it, my dear, it is exactly a case for the sea. Saline
                  air and immersion will be the very thing. My sensations tell me so already." In a
                  most friendly manner Mr. Heywood here interposed, entreating them not to think of
                  proceeding till the ankle had been examined and some refreshment taken, and very
                  cordially pressing <pb n="[b1-10]"/> them to make use of his house for both
                  purposes. "We are always well stocked," said he, "with all the common remedies for
                  sprains and bruises. And I will answer for the pleasure it will give my wife and
                  daughters to be of service to you in every way in their power." A twinge or two,
                  in trying to move his foot, disposed the traveller to think rather more than he
                  had done at first of the benefit of immediate assistance; and consulting his wife
                  in the few words of "Well, my dear, I believe it will be better for us," he turned
                  again to Mr. Heywood. "Before we accept your hospitality sir, and in order to do
                  away with any unfavourable impression which the sort of wild-goose chase you find
                  me in may have given rise to—allow me to tell you who we are. My name is Parker,
                  Mr. Parker of Sanditon; this lady, my wife, Mrs. Parker. We are on our road home
                  from London. My name perhaps—though I am by no means the first of my family
                  holding landed property in the parish of Sanditon —may be unknown <pb n="[b1-11]"
                  /> at this distance from the coast. But Sanditon itself—everybody has heard of
                  Sanditon. The favourite—for a young and rising bathing-place—certainly the
                  favourite spot of all that are to be found along the coast of Sussex; the most
                  favoured by nature, and promising to be the most chosen by man.—" —"Yes, I have
                  heard of Sanditon," replied Mr. Heywood. "Every five years, one hears of some new
                  place or other starting up by the sea and growing the fashion. How they can half
                  of them be filled is the wonder! Where people can be found with money and time to
                  go to them! Bad things for a country—sure to raise the price of provisions and
                  make the poor good for nothing—as I dare say you find, sir." "Not at all, sir, not
                  at all," cried Mr. Parker eagerly. "Quite the contrary, I assure you. A common
                  idea, but a mistaken one. It may apply to your large, overgrown places like
                  Brighton or Worthing or Eastbourne—but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to a small
                  village like Sanditon, precluded by its size from experiencing any of the evils
                     <pb n="[b1-12]"/> of civilization; while the growth of the place, the
                  buildings, the nursery grounds, the demand for everything and the sure resort of
                  the very best company—those regular, steady, private families of thorough
                  gentility and character who are a blessing everywhere —excite the industry of the
                  poor and diffuse comfort and improvement among them of every sort. No sir, I
                  assure you, Sanditon is not a place—" </p>
               <p> "I do not mean to take exception to any place in particular," answered Mr.
                  Heywood. "I only think our coast is too full of them altogether. But had we not
                  better try to get you—" </p>
               <p> Our coast too full!" repeated Mr. Parker. "On that point perhaps we may not
                  totally disagree. At least there are <hi rend="italic">enough.</hi> Our coast is
                  abundant enough. It demands no more. Everybody's taste and everybody's finances
                  may be suited. And those good people who are trying to add to the number are, in
                  my opinion, excessively absurd and must soon find themselves <pb n="[b1-13]"/> the
                  dupes of their own fallacious calculations. Such a place as Sanditon, sir, I may
                  say was wanted, was called for. Nature had marked it out, had spoken in most
                  intelligible characters. The finest, purest sea breeze on the coast—acknowledged
                  to be so— excellent bathing—fine hard sand—deep water ten yards from the shore—no
                  mud—no weeds—no slimy rocks. Never was there a place more palpably designed by
                  nature for the resort of the invalid—the very spot which thousands seemed in need
                  of! The most desirable distance from London! One complete, measured mile nearer
                  than Eastbourne. Only conceive, sir, the advantage of saving a whole mile in a
                  long journey. But Brinshore, sir, which I dare say you have in your eye—the
                  attempts of two or three speculating people about Brinshore this last year to
                  raise that paltry hamlet—lying as it does between a stagnant marsh, a bleak moor
                  and the constant effluvia of a ridge of putrefying seaweed—can end in nothing but
                  their own disappointment. <pb n="[b1-14]"/> What in the name of common sense is to
                     <hi rend="italic">recommend</hi> Brinshore? A most insalubrious air—roads
                  proverbially detestable—water brackish beyond example, impossible to get a good
                  dish of tea within three miles of the place. And as for the soil—it is so cold and
                  ungrateful that it can hardly be made to yield a cabbage. Depend upon it, sir,
                  that this is a most faithful description of Brinshore—not in the smallest degree
                  exaggerated—and if you have heard it differently spoken of—" </p>
               <p> "Sir, I never heard it spoken of in my life before," said Mr. Heywood. "I did not
                  know there was such a place in the world." "You did not! There, my dear," turning
                  with exultation to his wife, "you see how it is. So much for the celebrity of
                  Brinshore! This gentleman did not know there was such a place in the world. Why,
                  in truth, sir, I fancy we may apply to Brinshore that line of the poet Cowper in
                  his description <pb n="[b1-15]"/> of the religious cottager, as opposed to
                  Voltaire— <hi rend="italic">"She,</hi> never heard of half a mile from home."
                  "With all my heart, sir—apply any verses you like to it. But I want to see
                  something applied to your leg. And I am sure by your lady's countenance that she
                  is quite of my opinion and thinks it a pity to lose any more time. And here come
                  my girls to speak for themselves and their mother." Two or three genteel-looking
                  young women, followed by as many maid servants, were now seen issuing from the
                  house. "I began to wonder the bustle should not have reached <hi rend="italic"
                     >them. A</hi> thing of this kind soon makes a stir in a lonely place like ours,
                  Now, sir, let us see how you can be best conveyed into the house." The young
                  ladies approached and said everything that was proper to recommend their father's
                  offers, and in an unaffected manner calculated to make <pb n="[b1-16]"/> the
                  strangers easy. As Mrs. Parker was exceedingly anxious for relief—and her husband
                  by this time not much less disposed for it—a very few civil scruples were enough;
                  especially as the carriage, being now set up, was discovered to have received such
                  injury on the fallen side as to be unfit for present use. Mr. Parker was therefore
                  carried into the house and his carriage wheeled off to a vacant barn. </p>

               <p> The acquaintance, thus oddly begun, was neither short nor unimportant. For a
                  whole fortnight the travellers were fixed at Willingden, Mr. Parker's sprain
                  proving too serious for him to move sooner. He had fallen into very good hands.
                  The Heywoods were a thoroughly respectable family and every possible attention was
                  paid, in the kindest and most unpretending manner, to both husband and wife. <pb
                     n="[b1-17]"/>
                  <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was waited on and nursed, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
                  cheered and comforted with unremitting kindness; and as every office of
                  hospitality and friendliness was received as it ought, as there was not more good
                  will on one side than gratitude on the other, nor any deficiency of generally
                  pleasant manners in either, they grew to like each other in the course of that
                  fortnight exceedingly well. Mr. Parker's character and history were soon unfolded.
                  All that he understood of himself, he readily told, for he was very openhearted;
                  and where he might be himself in the dark, his conversation was still giving
                  information to such of the Heywoods as could observe. By such he was perceived to
                  be an enthusiast —on the subject of Sanditon, a complete enthusiast. Sanditon, the
                  success of Sanditon as a small, fashionable bathing place, was the object for
                  which he seemed to live. <pb n="[b1-18]"/> A very few years ago, it had been a
                  quiet village of no pretensions; but some natural advantages in its position and
                  some accidental circumstances having suggested to himself and the other principal
                  landholder the probability of its becoming a profitable speculation, they had
                  engaged in it, and planned and built, and praised and puffed, and raised it to
                  something of young renown; and Mr. Parker could now think of very little besides.
                  The facts which, in more direct communication, he laid before them were that he
                  was about five and thirty, had been married— very happily married—seven years, and
                  had four sweet children at home; that he was of a respectable family and easy,
                  though not large, fortune; no profession—succeeding as eldest son to the property
                  which two or three generations had been holding and accumulating before him; that
                  he had two brothers and two sisters, all single and all independent—the eldest of
                  the two former <pb n="[b1-19]"/> former indeed, by collateral inheritance, quite
                  as well provided for as himself. His object in quitting the high road to hunt for
                  an advertising surgeon was also plainly stated. It had not proceeded from any
                  intention of spraining his ankle or doing himself any other injury for the good of
                  such surgeon, nor (as Mr. Heywood had been apt to suppose) from any design of
                  entering into partnership with him; it was merely in consequence of a wish to
                  establish some medical man at Sanditon, which the nature of the advertisement
                  induced him to expect to accomplish in Willingden. He was convinced that the
                  advantage of a medical man at hand would very materially promote the rise and
                  prosperity of the place, would in fact tend to bring a prodigious influx; nothing
                  else was wanting. He had <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> reason to believe that <hi
                     rend="italic">one</hi> family had been deterred last year from trying Sanditon
                  on that account— and probably very many more—and his own sisters, who were sad
                  invalids and whom he <pb n="[b1-20]"/> was very anxious to get to Sanditon this
                  summer, could hardly be expected to hazard themselves in a place where they could
                  not have immediate medical advice. Upon the whole, Mr. Parker was evidently an
                  amiable family man, fond of wife, children, brothers and sisters, and generally
                  kind-hearted; liberal, gentlemanlike, easy to please; of a sanguine turn of mind,
                  with more imagination than judgement. And Mrs. Parker was as evidently a gentle,
                  amiable, sweet-tempered woman, the properest wife in the world for a man of strong
                  understanding but not of a capacity to supply the cooler reflection which her own
                  husband sometimes needed; and so entirely waiting to be guided on every occasion
                  that whether he was risking his fortune or spraining his ankle, she remained
                  equally useless. Sanditon was a second wife and four children to him, hardly less
                  dear, and certainly more engrossing. He could talk of it forever. It had indeed
                  the highest claims; not only those of birthplace, property and home; it was his
                  mine, his lottery, <pb n="[b1-21]"/> his speculation and his hobby horse; his
                  occupation, his hope and his futurity. He was extremely desirous of drawing his
                  good friends at Willingden thither; and his endeavours in the cause were as
                  grateful and disinterested as they were warm. He wanted to secure the promise of a
                  visit, to get as many of the family as his own house would contain to follow him
                  to Sanditon as soon as possible; and, healthy as they all undeniably were, foresaw
                  that every one of them would be benefited by the sea. He held it indeed as certain
                  that no person could be really well, no person (however upheld for the present by
                  fortuitous aids of exercise and spirits in a semblance of health) could be really
                  in a state of secure and permanent health without spending at least six weeks by
                  the sea every year. The sea air and sea bathing together were nearly infallible,
                  one or the other of them being a match for every disorder of the stomach, the
                  lungs or the blood. They were anti-spasmodic, anti-pulmonary, anti-septic,
                  anti-billious and anti-rheumatic. Nobody could catch cold by the sea; nobody
                  wanted appetite by the sea; <pb n="[b1-22]"/> nobody wanted spirits; nobody wanted
                  strength. Sea air was healing, softening, relaxing— fortifying and
                  bracing—seemingly just as was wanted—sometimes one, sometimes the other. If the
                  sea breeze failed, the sea-bath was the certain corrective; and where bathing
                  disagreed, the sea air alone was evidently designed by nature for the cure. His
                  eloquence, however, could not prevail. Mr. and Mrs. Heywood never left home.
                  Marrying early and having a very numerous family, their movements had, long been
                  limited to one small circle; and they were older in habits than in age. Excepting
                  two journeys to London in the year to receive his dividends, Mr. Heywood went no
                  farther than his feet or his well-tried old horse could carry him; and Mrs.
                  Heywood's adventurings were only now and then to visit her neighbours in the old
                  coach which had been new when they married and fresh-lined on their eldest son's
                  coming of age ten years ago. <pb n="[b1-23]"/> They had a very pretty property;
                  enough, had their family been of reasonable limits, to have allowed them a very
                  gentlemanlike share of luxuries and change; enough for them to have indulged in a
                  new carriage and better roads, an occasional month at Tunbridge Wells, and
                  symptoms of the gout and a winter at Bath, But the maintenance, education and
                  fitting out of fourteen children demanded a very quiet, settled, careful course of
                  life, and obliged them to be stationary and healthy at Willingden. What prudence
                  had at first enjoined was now rendered pleasant by habit. They never left home and
                  they had gratification in saying so. But very far from wishing their children to
                  do the same, they were glad to promote <hi rend="italic">their</hi> getting out
                  into the world as much as possible. They stayed at home that their children <hi
                     rend="italic">might</hi> get out; and, while making that home extremely
                  comfortable, welcomed every change from it which could give useful connections or
                  respectable acquaintance to sons or daughters. <pb n="[b1-24]"/> When Mr. and Mrs.
                  Parker, therefore, ceased from soliciting a family visit and bounded their views
                  to carrying back one daughter with them, no difficulties were started. It was
                  general pleasure and consent. Their invitation was to Miss Charlotte Heywood, a
                  very pleasing young woman of two and twenty, the eldest of the daughters at home
                  and the one who, under her mother's directions, had been particularly useful and
                  obliging to them; who had attended them most and knew them best. Charlotte was to
                  go: with excellent health, to bathe and be better if she could; to receive every
                  possible pleasure which Sanditon could made to supply by the gratitude of those
                  she went with; and to buy new parasols, new gloves and new brooches for her
                  sisters and herself at the library, which Mr. Parker was anxiously wishing to
                  support. All that Mr. Heywood himself could be persuaded to promise was that he
                  would send everyone to Sanditon who asked his advice, and that nothing should <pb
                     n="[b1-25]"/> ever induce him (as far as the future could be answered for) to
                  spend even five shilling at Brinshore. </p>

               <p> Every neighbourhood should have a great lady. The great lady of Sanditon was Lady
                  Denham; and in their journey from Willingden to the coast, Mr. Parker gave
                  Charlotte a more detailed account of her than had been called for before. She had
                  been necessarily often mentioned at Willingden—for being his colleague in
                  speculation, Sanditon itself could not be talked of long without the introduction
                  of Lady Denham. That she was a very rich old lady, who had buried two husbands,
                  who knew the value of money, and was very much looked up to and had a poor cousin
                  living with her, were facts already known; but some further particulars of her
                  history and her character served to lighten the tediousness of a long hill, or a
                  heavy bit of road, and to give the visiting young <pb n="[b1-26]"/> lady a
                  suitable knowledge of the person with whom she might now expect to be daily
                  associating. Lady Denham had been a rich Miss Brereton, born to wealth but not to
                  education. Her first husband had been a Mr. Hollis, a man of considerable property
                  in the country, of which a large share of the parish of Sanditon, with manor and
                  mansion house, made a part. He had been an elderly man when she married him, her
                  own age about thirty. Her motives for such a match could be little understood at
                  the distance of forty years, but she had so well nursed and pleased Mr. Hollis
                  that at his death he left her everything—all his estates, and all at her disposal.
                  After a widowhood of some years, she had been induced to marry again. The late Sir
                  Harry Denham, of Denham Park in the neighbourhood of Sanditon, had succeeded in
                  removing her and her large income to his own domains, but he could not succeed in
                  the views of permanently enriching his family which were attributed to him. She
                  had been too wary to put anything out of her own power and when, on Sir Harry's
                  decease, she returned again to her own house <pb n="[b1-27]"/> at Sanditon, she
                  was said to have made this boast to a friend: "that though she had <hi
                     rend="italic">got</hi> nothing but her title from the family, still she had <hi
                     rend="italic">given</hi> nothing for it. For the title, it was to be supposed,
                  she had married; and Mr. Parker acknowledged there being just such a degree of
                  value for it apparent now as to give her conduct that natural explanation. "There
                  is at times," said he, "a little self-importance—but it is not offensive—and there
                  are moments, there are points, when her love of money is carried greatly too far.
                  But she is a good-natured woman, a very good-natured woman—a very obliging,
                  friendly neighbour; a cheerful, independent, valuable character—and her faults may
                  be entirely imputed to her want of education. She has good natural sense, but
                  quite uncultivated. She has a fine active mind as well as a fine healthy frame for
                  a woman of seventy, and enters into the improvement of Sanditon with a spirit
                  truly admirable. Though now and then, a littleness <hi rend="italic">will</hi>
                  appear. She cannot look forward quite as I would have her and takes alarm at a
                  trifling present expense without considering what returns it <hi rend="italic"
                     >will</hi> make her in a year or two. </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="[b1-28]"/> That is, we think <hi rend="italic">differently.</hi> We now and
                  then see things <hi rend="italic">differently,</hi> Miss Heywood. Those who tell
                  their own story, you know, must be listened to with caution. When you see us in
                  contact, you will judge for yourself." Lady Denham was indeed a great lady beyond
                  the common wants of society, for she had many thousands a year to bequeath, and
                  three distinct sets of people to be courted by: her own relations, who might very
                  reasonably wish for her original thirty thousand pounds among them; the legal
                  heirs of Mr. Hollis, who must hope to be more indebted to <hi rend="italic"
                     >her</hi> sense of justice than he had allowed them to be to <hi rend="italic"
                     >his;</hi> and those members of the Denham family whom her second husband had
                  hoped to make a good bargain for. By all of these, or by branches of them, she had
                  no doubt been long, and still continued to be, well attacked; and of these three
                  divisions, Mr. Parker did not hesitate to say that Mr. Hollis's kindred were the
                     <hi rend="italic">least</hi> in favour and Sir Harry Denham's the <hi
                     rend="italic">most.</hi> The former, he believed, had done themselves
                  irremediable harm by expressions of very unwise and unjustifiable resentment at
                  the time of Mr. Hollis's death; the <pb n="[b1-29]"/> latter had the advantage of
                  being the remnant of a connection which she certainly valued, of having been known
                  to her from their childhood and of being always at hand to preserve their interest
                  by reasonable attention. Sir Edward, the present baronet, nephew to Sir Harry,
                  resided constantly at Denham Park; and Mr. Parker had little doubt that he and his
                  sister, Miss Denham, who lived with him, would be principally remembered in her
                  will. He sincerely hoped it. Miss Denham had a very small provision; and her
                  brother was a poor man for his rank in society. "He is a warm friend to Sanditon,"
                  said Mr. Parker, "and his hand would be as liberal as his heart, had he the power.
                  He would be a noble coadjutor! As it is, he does what he can and is running up a
                  tasteful little Cottage Ornèe on a strip of waste ground Lady Denham has granted
                  him, which I have no doubt we shall have many a candidate for before the end even
                  of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> season." Till within the last twelvemonth, Mr.
                  Parker had considered Sir Edward as standing without a rival, as having the
                  fairest chance of succeeding to the greater part of all that she had to give; but
                  there were now <pb n="[b1-30]"/> another person's claims to be taken into
                  account—those of the young female relation whom Lady Denham had been induced to
                  receive into her family. After having always protested against any such addition,
                  and long and often enjoyed the repeated defeats she had given to every attempt of
                  her relations to introduce this young lady or that young lady as a companion at
                  Sanditon House, she had brought back with her from London last Michaelmas a Miss
                  Brereton, who bid fair by her merits to vie in favour with Sir Edward and to
                  secure for herself and her family that share of the accumulated property which
                  they had certainly the best right to inherit. Mr. Parker spoke warmly of Clara
                  Brereton, and the interest of his story increased very much with the introduction
                  of such a character. Charlotte listened with more than amusement now; it was
                  solicitude and enjoyment, as she heard her described to be lovely, amiable,
                  gentle, unassuming, conducting herself uniformly with great good sense, and
                  evidently gaining by her innate worth on the affections of her patroness. Beauty,
                  sweetness, <pb n="[b1-31]"/> poverty and dependence do not want the imagination of
                  a man to operate upon; with due exceptions, woman feels for woman very promptly
                  and compassionately. He gave the particulars which had led to Clara's admission at
                  Sanditon as no bad exemplification of that mixture of character—that union of
                  littleness with kindness and good sense, even liberality—which he saw in Lady
                  Denham. After having avoided London for many years, principally on account of
                  these very cousins who were continually writing, inviting and tormenting her, and
                  whom she was determined to keep at a distance, she had been obliged to go there
                  last Michaelmas with the certainty of being detained at least a fortnight. She had
                  gone to a hotel, living by her own account as prudently as possible to defy the
                  reputed expensiveness of such a home, and at the end of three days calling for her
                  bill that she might judge of her state. Its amount was such as determined her on
                  staying not another hour in the house, and she was preparing—in all the anger and
                  perturbation of her belief in very gross imposition and her ignorance of where to
                  go for better usage—to leave the hotel at all hazards, when the cousins, the
                  politic and lucky cousins, who seemed always to have a spy on her, introduced
                  themselves at this important moment; and learning her situation, persuaded her to
                  accept such a home for the rest of her stay as their humbler <pb n="[b1-32]"/>
                  house in a very inferior part of London could offer. She went, was delighted with
                  her welcome and the hospitality and attention she received from everybody; found
                  her good cousins the Breretons beyond her expectation worthy people; and finally
                  was impelled by a personal knowledge of their narrow income and pecuniary
                  difficulties to invite one of the girls of the family to pass the winter with her.
                  The invitation was to <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> for six months, with the
                  probability of another being then to take her place; but in <hi rend="italic"
                     >selecting</hi> the one, Lady Denham had shown the good part of her character
                  For, passing by the actual daughters of the house, she had chosen Clara, a niece,
                  more helpless and more pitiable of course than any—a dependent on poverty—an
                  additional burden on an encumbered circle; and one who had been so low in every
                  worldly view as, with all her natural endowments and powers, to have been
                  preparing for a situation little better than a nursery maid. Clara had returned
                  with her and by her good sense and merit had now, to all appearance, secured a
                  very strong hold in Lady Denham's regard. The six months had long been over and
                  not a syllable was breathed of any change or exchange. She was a general
                  favourite. The influence of her steady conduct and mild, gentle temper was felt by
                  everybody. The prejudices which had met her at first, in some quarters, were all
                  dissipated. She was felt to be worthy of trust, to be the very companion who would
                  guide and soften Lady Denham, who would enlarge her mind and open her hand. She
                  was as thoroughly amiable as she was lovely; and since having had the advantage of
                  their Sanditon breezes, that loveliness was complete. </p>

               <p> "And whose very snug-looking place is this?" said Charlotte as, in a sheltered
                  dip within two miles of the sea, they passed close by a moderate-sized house, well
                  fenced and planted, and rich in the garden, orchard and meadows which are the best
                  embellishments of such a dwelling. "It seems to have as many comforts about it as
                  Willingden." "Ah," said Mr. Parker. "This is my old house, the house of my
                  forefathers, the house where I and all my brothers and sisters were born and bred,
                  and where my own three eldest children were born; where Mrs. Parker and I lived
                  till within the last two years, till our new house was finished. I am glad you are
                  pleased with it. It is an honest old place; and Hillier keeps it in very good
                  order. I have given it up, you know, to the man who occupies the chief of my land.
                  He gets a better house by it, and I, a rather better situation! One other hill
                  brings us to Sanditon—modern Sanditon—a beautiful spot. Our ancestors, you know,
                  always built in a hole, Here were we, pent down in this little contracted nook,
                  without air or view, only one mile and <pb n="[b2-2]"/> three quarters from the
                  noblest expanse of ocean between the South Foreland and Land's End, and without
                  the smallest advantage from it. You will not think I have made a bad exchange when
                  we reach Trafalgar House—which by the bye, I almost wish I had not named
                  Trafalgar—for Waterloo is more the thing now. However, Waterloo is in reserve; and
                  if we have encouragement enough this year for a little crescent to be ventured on
                  (as I trust we shall) then we shall be able to call it Waterloo Crescent—and the
                  name joined to the form of the building, which always takes, will give us the
                  command of lodgers. In a good season we should have more applications than we
                  could attend to." "It was always a very comfortable house," said Mrs. Parker,
                  looking at it through the back window with something like the fondness of regret.
                  "And such a nice garden—such an excellent garden." "Yes, my love, but <hi
                     rend="italic">that</hi> we may be said to carry with us. It supplies us, as
                  before, with all the fruit and vegetables we want. And we have, in fact, all the
                  comfort of an excellent kitchen garden without the constant eyesore of its
                  formalities or the yearly nuisance of its decaying vegetation. Who can endure a
                  cabbage bed in October?" <pb n="[b2-3]"/> "Oh dear, yes. We are quite as well off
                  for gardenstuff as ever we were; for if it is forgot to be brought at any time, we
                  can always buy what we want at Sanditon House. The gardener there is glad enough
                  to supply us. But it was a nice place for the children to run about in. So shady
                  in summer!" "My dear, we shall have shade enough on the hill, and more than enough
                  in the course of a very few years. The growth of my plantations is a general
                  astonishment. In the meanwhile we have the canvas awning which gives us the most
                  complete comfort within doors. And you can get a parasol at Whitby's for little
                  Mary at any time, or a large bonnet at Jebb's. And as for the boys, I must say I
                  would rather <hi rend="italic">them</hi> run about in the sunshine than not. I am
                  sure we agree, my dear, in wishing our boys to be as hardy as possible." "Yes
                  indeed, I am sure we do. And I will get Mary a little parasol, which will make her
                  as proud as can be. How grave she will walk about with it and fancy herself quite
                  a little woman. Oh, I have not the smallest doubt of our being a great deal better
                  off where we are now. If we any of us want to bathe, we have not a quarter of a
                  mile to go. But you <pb n="[b2-4]"/> know," still looking back, "one loves to look
                  at an old friend at a place where one has been happy—The Milliers did not seem to
                  feel the storms last winter at all. I remember seeing Mrs. Millier after one of
                  those dreadful nights, when <hi rend="italic">we</hi> had been literally rocked in
                  our bed, and she did not seem at all aware of the wind being anything more than
                  common." "Yes, yes, that's likely enough. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> have all the
                  grandeur of the storm with less real danger because the wind, meeting with nothing
                  to oppose or confine it around our house, simply rages and passes on; while down
                  in this gutter, nothing is known of the state of the air below the tops of the
                  trees; and the inhabitants may be taken totally unawares by one of those dreadful
                  currents, which do more mischief in a valley when they <hi rend="italic">do</hi>
                  arise than an open country ever experiences in the heaviest gale. But, my dear
                  love, as to gardenstuff, you were saying that any accidental omission is supplied
                  in a moment by Lady Denham's gardener. But it occurs to me that we ought to go
                  elsewhere upon such occasions, and that old Stringer and his son have a higher
                  claim. I encouraged him to set up, you know, and am afraid he does not do very
                  well. That is, <pb n="[b2-5]"/> there has not been time enough yet. He <hi
                     rend="italic">will</hi> do very well beyond a doubt. But at first it is uphill
                  work, and therefore we must give him what help we can. When any vegetables or
                  fruit happen to be wanted—and it will not be amiss to have them often wanted, to
                  have something or other forgotten most days; just to have a nominal supply, you
                  know, that poor old Andrew may not lose his daily job—but in fact to buy the chief
                  of our consumption from the Stringers." "Very well, my love, that can be easily
                  done. And cook will be satisfied, which will be a great comfort, for she is always
                  complaining of old Andrew now and says he never brings her what she wants.
                  There—now the old house is quite left behind. What is it your brother Sidney says
                  about its being a hospital?" </p>
               <p> "Oh, my dear Mary, merely a joke of his. He pretends to advise me to make a
                  hospital of it. Me pretends to laugh at my improvements. Sidney says anything, you
                  know. He has always said what he chose, of and to us all. Most families have such
                  a member among them, I believe, Miss Heywood. There is someone in most families
                  privileged by superior abilities or spirits to say anything. In ours, it is
                  Sidney, who is a very clever young man and with great powers of pleasing. He lives
                  too much in the world to be settled; that is his only fault. Me is here and there
                  and everywhere. I wish we may <pb n="[b2-6]"/> get him to Sanditon. I should like
                  to have you acquainted with him. And it would be a fine thing for the place! Such
                  a young man as Sidney, with his neat equipage and fashionable air. You and I,
                  Mary, know what effect it might have. Many a respectable family, many a careful
                  mother, many a pretty daughter might it secure us to the prejudice of Eastbourne
                  and Hastings." They were now approaching the church and neat village of old
                  Sanditon, which stood at the foot of the hill they were afterwards to ascend—a
                  hill whose side was covered with the woods and enclosures of Sanditon House and
                  whose height ended in an open down where the new buildings might soon be looked
                  for. A branch only of the valley, winding more obliquely towards the sea, gave a
                  passage to an inconsiderable stream, and formed at its mouth a third habitable
                  division in a small cluster of fishermen's houses. The original village contained
                  little more than cottages; but the spirit of the day had been caught, as Mr.
                  Parker observed with delight to Charlotte, and two or three of the best of them
                  were smartened up with a white curtain and "Lodgings to let"; and farther on, in
                  the little green court of an old farm house, two <pb n="[b2-7]"/> females in
                  elegant white were actually to be seen with their books and camp stools; and in
                  turning the corner of the baker's shop, the sound of a harp might be heard through
                  the upper casement, Such sights and sounds were highly blissful to Mr. Parker. Not
                  that he had any personal concern in the success of the village itself; for
                  considering it as too remote from the beach, he had done nothing there; but it was
                  a most valuable proof of the increasing fashion of the place altogether. If the
                     <hi rend="italic">village</hi> could attract, the hill might be nearly full. He
                  anticipated an amazing season. At the same time last year (late in July) there had
                  not been a single lodger in the village! Nor did he remember any during the whole
                  summer, excepting one family of children who came from London for sea air after
                  the whooping cough, and whose mother would not let them be nearer the shore for
                  fear of their tumbling in. "Civilization, civilization indeed!" cried Mr. Parker,
                  delighted. "Look, my dear Mary, look at William Heeley's windows. Blue shoes, and
                  nankin boots! Who would have expected such a sight at a shoemaker’s in old
                  Sanditon! This is new within the month. There was no blue shoe when we passed this
                  way a month ago. Glorious indeed! Well, I think I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done
                  something in my day. Now, for <pb n="[b2-8]"/> our hill, our health-breathing
                  hill." In ascending, they passed the lodge gates of Sanditon House and saw the top
                  of the house itself among its groves. It was the last building of former days in
                  that line of the parish. A little higher up, the modern began; and in crossing the
                  down, a prospect House, a Bellevue Cottage and a Denham Place were to be looked at
                  by Charlotte with the calmness of amused curiosity, and by Mr. Parker with the
                  eager eye which hoped to see scarcely any empty houses. More bills at the windows
                  than he had calculated on, and a smaller show of company on the hill —fewer
                  carriages, fewer walkers. He had fancied it just the time of day for them to be
                  all returning from their airings to dinner; but the sands and the Terrace always
                  attracted some, and the tide must be flowing—about half-tide now. He longed to be
                  on the sands, the cliffs, at his own house, and everywhere out of his house at
                  once. His spirits rose with the very sight of the sea and he could almost feel his
                  ankle getting stronger already. Trafalgar House, on the most elevated spot on the
                  down, was a light, elegant building, standing in a small lawn with a very young
                  plantation round it, <pb n="[b2-9]"/> about a hundred yards from the brow of a
                  steep but not very lofty cliff, and the nearest to it of every building, excepting
                  one short row of smart-looking houses called the Terrace, with a broad walk in
                  front, aspiring to be the Mall of the place. In this row were the best milliner's
                  shop and the library a little detached from it, the hotel and billiard room. Here
                  began the descent to the beach and to the bathing machines. And this was therefore
                  the favourite spot for beauty and fashion. At Trafalgar House, rising at a little
                  distance behind the Terrace, the travellers were safely set down; and all was
                  happiness and joy between Papa and Mama and their children; while Charlotte,
                  having received possession of her apartment, found amusement enough in standing at
                  her ample Venetian window and looking over the miscellaneous foreground of
                  unfinished buildings, waving linen and tops of houses, to the sea, dancing and
                  sparkling in sunshine and freshness. </p>

               <p> When they met before dinner, Mr. Parker was looking over letters. "Not a line
                  from Sidney!" said he. "He is an idle fellow. I sent him an account of my <pb
                     n="[b2-10]"/> accident from Willingden and thought he would have vouchsafed me
                  an answer. But perhaps it implies that he is coming himself. I trust it may. But
                  here is a letter from one of my sisters. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> never fail
                  me. Women are the only correspondents to be depended on. Now, Mary," smiling at
                  his wife, "before I open it, what shall we guess as to the state of health of
                  those it comes from—or rather what would Sidney say if he were here? Sidney is a
                  saucy fellow, Miss Heywood. And you must know, he will have it there is a good
                  deal of imagination in my two sisters' complaints. But it really is not so—or very
                  little. They have wretched health, as you have heard us say frequently, and are
                  subject to a variety of very serious disorders. Indeed, I do not believe they know
                  what a day's health is. And at the same time, they are such excellent useful women
                  and have so much energy of character that where any good is to be done, they force
                  themselves on exertions which, to those who do not thoroughly know them, have an
                  extraordinary appearance. But there is really no affectation about them. They have
                     <pb n="[b2-11]"/> only weaker constitutions and stronger minds than are often
                  met with, either separate or together. And our youngest brother, who lives with
                  them and who is not much above twenty, I am sorry to say is almost as great an
                  invalid as themselves. He is so delicate that he can engage in no profession.
                  Sidney laughs at him. But it really is no joke, though Sidney often makes me laugh
                  at them all in spite of myself. Now, if he were here, I know he would be offering
                  odds that either Susan, Diana or Arthur would appear by this letter to have been
                  at the point of death within the last month." Having run his eye over the letter,
                  he shook his head and began, "No chance of seeing them at Sanditon I am sorry to
                  say. A very indifferent account of them indeed. Seriously, a very indifferent
                  account. Mary, you will be quite sorry to hear how ill they have been and are.
                  Miss Heywood, if you will give me leave, I will read Diana's letter aloud. I like
                  to have my friends acquainted with each other and I am afraid this is the only
                  sort of acquaintance l shall have the means of accomplishing between you. And I
                  can have no scruple on Diana's account; for her letters <pb n="[b2-12]"/> show her
                  exactly as she is, the most active, friendly, warmhearted being in existence, and
                  therefore must give a good impression." He read: <hi rend="italic"> My dear Tom,
                     we were all much grieved at your accident, and if you had not described
                     yourself as fallen into such very good hands, I should have been with you at
                     all hazards the day after the receipt of your letter, though it found me
                     suffering under a more severe attack than usual of my old grievance, spasmodic
                     bile, and hardly able to crawl from my bed to the sofa. But how were you
                     treated.? Send me more Particulars in your next. If indeed a simple sprain, as
                     you denominate it, nothing would have been so judicious as friction, friction
                     by the hand alone, supposing it could be applied instantly. Two years ago I
                     happened to be calling on Mrs. Sheldon when her coachman sprained his foot as
                     he was cleaning the </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic"> carriage and could hardly limp into the house, but by the
                     immediate use of friction alone steadily persevered in (and I rubbed his ankle
                     with my own hand for six hours without intermission) he was well in three days.
                     Many thanks, <pb n="[b2-13]"/> my dear Tom, for the kindness with respect to
                     us, which had so large a share in bringing on your accident. But pray never run
                     into peril again in looking for an apothecary on our account, for had you the
                     most experienced man in his line settled at Sanditon, it would be no
                     recommendation to us. We have entirely done with the whole medical tribe. We
                     have consulted physician after physician in vain, till we are quite convinced
                     that they can do nothing for us and that we must trust to our own knowledge of
                     our own wretched constitutions for any relief. But if you think it advisable
                     for the interest of the place to get a medical man there, I will undertake the
                     commission with pleasure, and have no doubt of succeeding. I could soon put the
                     necessary irons in the fire. As for getting to Sanditon myself, it is quite an
                     impossibility. I grieve to say that I dare not attempt it but my feelings tell
                     me too plainly that, in my present state, the sea air would probably be the
                     death of me. And neither of my dear companions will leave me or I would <pb
                        n="[b2-14]"/> promote their going down to you for a fortnight. But in truth,
                     I doubt whether Susan’s nerves would be equal to the effort. She has been
                     suffering much from the headache, and six leeches a day for ten days together
                     relieved her so little that we thought it right to change our measures,—and
                     being convinced on examination that much of the evil lay in her gum, I
                     persuaded her to attack the disorder there. She has accordingly had three teeth
                     drawn, and is decidedly better, but her nerves are a good deal deranged. She
                     can only speak in a whisper and fainted away twice this morning on poor
                     Arthur's trying to suppress a cough. He, I am happy </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic"> to say, is tolerably well though more languid than I like and I
                     fear for his liver. I have heard nothing of Sidney since your being together in
                     town, but conclude his scheme to the Isle of Wight has not taken place or we
                     should have seen him in his way. Most sincerely do we wish you a good season at
                     Sanditon, and though we cannot contribute to your beau monde in person, we are
                     doing our utmost to send you company worth having and think we may safely
                     reckon on securing you two <pb n="[b2-15]"/> large families. One a rich West
                     Indian from Surrey, the other a most respectable Girls Boarding School, or
                     Academy, from Camberwell. I will not tell you how many people I have employed
                     in the business—wheel within wheel. But success more than repays. Yours most
                     affectionately—etcetera. </hi>
               </p>
               <p> "Well," said Mr. Parker, as he finished. "Though I dare say Sidney might find
                  something extremely entertaining in this letter and make us laugh for half an hour
                  together, I declare <hi rend="italic">I</hi> , by myself can see nothing in it but
                  what is either very pitiable or very creditable. With all their sufferings, you
                  perceive how much they are occupied in promoting the good of others! So anxious
                  for Sanditon! Two large families—one for Prospect House prob ably, the other for
                  Number two Denham place or the end house of the Terrace, with extra beds at the
                  hotel. I told you my sister were excellent women, Miss Heywood." "And I am sure
                  they must be very extraordinary ones," said Charlotte. "I am astonished at the
                  cheerful style of the letter, considering the state in which both sisters appear
                  to be. Their teeth drawn at once—frightful! Your sister Diana seems almost as ill
                  as possible, but those three teeth of your sister Susan are <pb n="[b2-16]"/> more
                  distressing than all the rest." "Oh, they are so used to the operation—to every
                  operation and have such fortitude!" "Your sisters know what they are about, I dare
                  say, but their measures seem to touch on extremes. I feel that in any illness l
                  should be so anxious for professional advice, so very little venturesome for
                  myself or anybody I loved! But then, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have been so
                  healthy a family that I can be no judge of what the habit of self-doctoring may
                  do." "Why to own the truth," said Mrs. Parker, "I do think the Miss Parkers carry
                  it too far sometimes. And so do you, my love, you know. You often think they would
                  be better if they would leave themselves more alone—and especially Arthur. I know
                  you think it a great pity they should give <hi rend="italic">him</hi> such a turn
                  for being ill." "Well, well, my dear Mary, I grant you, it <hi rend="italic"
                     >is</hi> unfortunate for poor Arthur that at his time of life he should be
                  encouraged to give way to indisposition. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> bad that he
                  should be fancying himself too sickly for any profession and sit down at one and
                  twenty, on the interest of his own little fortune, without any idea of attempting
                  to improve it or of engaging in <pb n="[b2-17]"/> any occupation that may be of
                  use to himself or others. But let us talk of pleasanter things. These two large
                  families are just what we wanted. But here is something at hand pleasanter
                  still—Morgan with his "Dinner on table." </p>

               <p> The Party were very soon moving after dinner. Mr. Parker could not be satisfied
                  without an early visit to the library and the library subscription book; and
                  Charlotte was glad to see as much and as quickly as possible where all was new.
                  They were out in the very quietest part of a watering-place day, when the
                  important business of dinner or of sitting after dinner was going on in almost
                  every inhabited lodging. Here and there might be seen a solitary elderly man, who
                  was forced to move early and walk for health; but in general, it was a thorough
                  pause of company. It was emptiness and tranquillity on the Terrace, the cliffs and
                  the sands. The shops were deserted. The straw hats and pendant lace seemed left to
                  their fate both within the house and without, <pb n="[b2-18]"/> and Mrs. Whitby at
                  the library was sitting in her inner room, reading one of her own novels for want
                  of employment. The list of subscribers was but commonplace. The Lady Denham, Miss
                  Brereton, Mr. and Mrs. Parker, Sir Edward Denham and Miss Denham, whose names
                  might be said to lead off the season, were followed by nothing better than: Mrs.
                  Mathews, Miss Mathews, Miss E. Mathews, Miss H. Mathews; Dr. and Mrs. Brown; Mr.
                  Richard Pratt; Lieutenant Smith R.N.; Captain Little —Limehouse; Mrs. Jane Fisher,
                  Miss Fisher, Miss Scroggs; Reverend Mr. Hanking; Mr. Beard—Solicitor, Grays Inn;
                  Mrs. Davis and Miss Merryweather. Mr. Parker could not but feel that the list was
                  not only without distinction but less numerous than he had hoped. It was but July,
                  however, and August and September were the months. And besides, the promised large
                  families from Surrey and Camberwell were an ever-ready consolation. Mrs. Whitby
                  came forward without delay from her literary recess, delighted to see Mr. Parker,
                  whose manners recommended him to everybody, and they were fully occupied in their
                  various <pb n="[b2-19]"/> civilities and communications; while Charlotte, having
                  added her name to the list as the first offering to the success of the season, was
                  busy in some immediate purchases for the further good of everybody as soon as Miss
                  Whitby could be hurried down from her toilette, with all her glossy curls and
                  smart trinkets, to wait on her. The library, of course, afforded everything: all
                  the useless things in the world that could not be done without; and among so many
                  pretty temptations, and with so much good will for Mr. Parker to encourage
                  expenditure, Charlotte began to feel that she must check herself—or rather she
                  reflected that at two and twenty there could be no excuse for her doing
                  otherwise—and that it would not do for her to be spending all her money the very
                  first evening. She took up a book; it happened to be a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                     >Camilla.</hi> She had not Camilla's youth, and had no intention of having her
                  distress; so she turned from the drawers of rings and brooches, repressed further
                  solicitation and paid for what she had bought. For her particular gratification,
                  they were then to take a turn on the cliff; but as they quitted the library they
                  were met by two ladies <pb n="[b2-20]"/> whose arrival made an alteration
                  necessary: Lady Denham and Miss Brereton. They had been to Trafalgar House and
                  been directed thence to the library; and though Lady Denham was a great deal too
                  active to regard the walk of a mile as anything requiring rest, and talked of
                  going home again directly, the Parkers knew that to be pressed into their house
                  and obliged to take her tea with them would suit her best; and therefore the
                  stroll on the cliff gave way to an immediate return home. "No, no," said her
                  Ladyship. "I will not have you hurry your tea on my account. I know you like your
                  tea late. My early hours are not to put my neighbours to inconvenience. No, no,
                  Miss Clara and I will get back to our own tea. We came out with no other thought.
                  We wanted just to see you and make sure of your being really come—but we get back
                  to our own tea. " She went on however towards Trafalgar House and took possession
                  of the drawing room very quietly without seeming to hear a word of Mrs. Parker's
                  orders to the servant, as they entered, to bring tea directly. Charlotte was fully
                  consoled for the loss <pb n="[b2-21]"/> of her walk by finding herself in company
                  with those whom the conversation of the morning had given her a great curiosity to
                  see. She observed them well. Lady Denham was of middle height, stout, upright and
                  alert in her motions, with a shrewd eye and self-satisfied air but not an
                  unagreeable countenance; and though her manner was rather downright and abrupt, as
                  of a person who valued herself on being free-spoken, there was a good humour and
                  cordiality about her—a civility and readiness to be acquainted with Charlotte
                  herself and a heartiness of welcome towards her old friends— which was inspiring
                  the good will she seemed to feel. And as for Miss Brereton, her appearance so
                  completely justified Mr. Parker's praise that Charlotte thought she had never
                  beheld a more lovely or more interesting young woman. Elegantly tall, regularly
                  handsome, with great delicacy of complexion and soft blue eyes, a sweetly modest
                  and yet naturally graceful address, Charlotte could see in her only the most
                  perfect representation of whatever heroine might be most beautiful and bewitching
                  in all the numerous volumes they had left behind on Mrs. Whitby's shelves. perhaps
                  it might be partly <pb n="[b2-22]"/> owing to her having just issued from a
                  circulating library but she could not separate the idea of a complete heroine from
                  Clara Brereton. Her situation with Lady Denham so very much in favour of it! She
                  seemed placed with her on purpose to be ill-used. Such poverty and dependence
                  joined to such beauty and merit seemed to leave no choice in the business. These
                  feelings were not the result of any spirit of romance in Charlotte herself. No,
                  she was a very sober-minded young lady, sufficiently well-read in novels to supply
                  her imagination with amusement, but not at all unreasonably influenced by them;
                  and while she pleased herself the first five minutes with fancying the persecution
                  which <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be the lot of the interesting Clara,
                  especially in the form of the most barbarous conduct on Lady Denham's side, she
                  found no reluctance to admit from subsequent observation that they appeared to be
                  on very comfortable terms. She could see nothing worse in Lady Denham than the
                  sort of old-fashioned formality of always calling her <hi rend="italic">Miss
                     Clara;</hi> nor anything objectionable in the degree of observance and
                  attention which Clara paid. On one side it seemed protecting <pb n="[b2-23]"/>
                  kindness, on the other grateful and affectionate respect. The conversation turned
                  entirely upon Sanditon, its present number of visitants and the chances of a good
                  season. It was evident that Lady Denham had more anxiety, more fears of loss, than
                  her coadjutor. She wanted to have the place fill faster and seemed to have many
                  harassing apprehensions of the lodgings being in some instances underlet. Miss
                  Diana Parker's two large families were not forgotten. "Very good, very good," said
                  her Ladyship. "A West Indy family and a school. That sounds well. That will bring
                  money." "No people spend more freely, I believe, than West Indians," observed Mr.
                  Parker. "Aye, so l have heard; and because they have full purses fancy themselves
                  equal, maybe, to your old country families. But then, they who scatter their money
                  so freely never think of whether they may not be doing mischief by raising the
                  price of things. And I have heard that's very much the case with your
                  West-ingines. And if they come among us to raise the price of our necessaries of
                  life, we shall not much thank them, Mr. Parker." "My dear Madam, they can only
                  raise the price of <pb n="[b2-24]"/> consumable articles by such an extraordinary
                  demand for them and such a diffusion of money among us as must do us more good
                  than harm. Our butchers and bakers and traders in general cannot get rich without
                  bringing prosperity to <hi rend="italic">us.</hi> If <hi rend="italic">they</hi>
                  do not gain, our rents must be insecure; and in proportion to their profit must be
                  ours eventually in the increased value of our houses." "Oh! well. But I should not
                  like to have butcher's meat raised, though. And I shall keep it down as long as I
                  can. Aye, that young lady smiles, l see. I dare say she thinks me an odd sort of
                  creature; but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will come to care about such matters
                  herself in time. Yes, yes, my dear, depend upon it, you will be thinking of the
                  price of butcher's meat in time, though you may not happen to have quite such a
                  servants' hall to feed as I have. And I do believe those are best off that have
                  fewest servants. I am not a woman of parade as all the world knows, and if it was
                  not for what I owe to poor Mr. Hollis's memory, I should never keep up Sanditon
                  House as I do. It is not for my own pleasure. Well, Mr. Parker, and the other is a
                     <pb n="[b2-25]"/> boarding school, a French boarding school, is it? No harm in
                  that. They'll stay their six weeks. And out of such a number, who knows but some
                  may be consumptive and want asses' milk; and I have two milch asses at this
                  present time. But perhaps the little Misses may hurt the furniture. I hope they
                  will have a good sharp governess to look after them." Poor Mr. Parker got no more
                  credit from Lady Denham than he had from his sisters for the object which had
                  taken him to Willingden. "Lord! my dear sir," she cried. "How could you think of
                  such a thing? I am very sorry you met with your accident, but upon my word, you
                  deserved it. Going after a doctor! Why, what should we do with a doctor here? It
                  would be only encouraging our servants and the poor to fancy themselves ill if
                  there was a doctor at hand. Oh! pray, let us have none of the tribe at Sanditon.
                  We go on very well as we are. There is the sea and the downs and my milch asses.
                  And I have told Mrs. Whitby that if anybody inquires for a chamber-horse, they may
                  be supplied at a fair rate—poor Mr. Hollis's chamber-horse, as good as new—and
                  what can <pb n="[b2-26]"/> people want for more? Here have I lived seventy good
                  years in the world and never took physic above twice—and never saw the face of a
                  doctor in all my life on my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> account. And I verily
                  believe if my poor dear Sir Harry had never seen one neither, he would have been
                  alive now. Ten fees, one after another, did the man take who sent <hi
                     rend="italic">him</hi> out of the world. I beseech you Mr. Parker, no doctors
                  here." </p>
               <p> The tea things were brought in. "Oh, my dear Mrs. Parker, you should not
                  indeed—why would you do so? I was just upon the point of wishing you good evening.
                  But since you are so very neighbourly, I believe Miss Clara and I must stay." </p>

               <head type="main">Chapter 7.</head>
               <p> The popularity of the Parkers brought them some visitors the very next morning;
                  amongst them, Sir Edward Denham and his sister who having been at Sanditon House,
                  drove on to pay their compliments; and the duty of letter writing being
                  accomplished, Charlotte was settled with Mrs. Parker in the drawing room in time
                  to see them all. The Denhams were the only ones to excite particular attention.
                  Charlotte was glad to complete her knowledge of the family by an introduction to
                  them; and found them, <pb n="[b2-27]"/> the better half at least (for while
                  single, the <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> may sometimes be thought the better
                  half of the pair) not unworthy of notice. Miss Denham was a fine young woman, but
                  cold and reserved, giving the idea of one who felt her consequence with pride and
                  her poverty with discontent, and who was immediately gnawed by the want of a
                  handsomer equipage than the simple gig in which they travelled, and which their
                  groom was leading about still in her sight. Sir Edward was much her superior in
                  air and manner—certainly handsome, but yet more to be remarked for his very good
                  address and wish of paying attention and giving pleasure. He came into the room
                  remarkably well, talked much—and very much to Charlotte, by whom he chanced to be
                  placed—and she soon perceived that he had a fine countenance, a most pleasing
                  gentleness of voice and a great deal of conversation. She liked him. Sober-minded
                  as she was, she thought him agreeable and did not quarrel with the suspicion of
                  his finding her equally so, which <hi rend="italic">would</hi> arise from his
                  evidently disregarding his sister's motion to go, and persisting in <pb
                     n="[b2-28]"/> his station and his discourse. I make no apologies for my
                  heroine's vanity. If there are young ladies in the world at her time of life more
                  dull of fancy and more careless of pleasing, I know them not and never wish to
                  know them. At last, from the low French windows of the drawing room which
                  commanded the road and all the paths across the down, Charlotte and Sir Edward as
                  they sat could not but observe Lady Denham and Miss Brereton walking by; and there
                  was instantly a slight change in Sir Edward's countenance—with an anxious glance
                  after them as they proceeded—followed by an early proposal to his sister, not
                  merely for moving, but for walking on together to the Terrace, which altogether
                  gave a hasty turn to Charlotte's fancy, cured her of her half-hour's fever, and
                  placed her in a more capable state of judging, when Sir Edward was gone, of <hi
                     rend="italic">how</hi> agreeable he had actually been. "perhaps there was a
                  good deal in his air and address; and his title did him no harm." She was very
                  soon in his company again. The first object of the Parkers, when their house was
                  cleared of morning visitors, was to get out themselves. The Terrace was the
                  attraction to all. Everybody who walked must begin with the Terrace; <pb
                     n="[b2-29]"/> and there, seated on one of the two green benches by the gravel
                  walk, they found the united Denham party; but though united in the gross, very
                  distinctly divided again: the two superior ladies being at one end of the bench,
                  and Sir Edward and Miss Brereton at the other. Charlotte s first glance told her
                  that Sir Edward's air was that of a lover. There could be no doubt of his devotion
                  to Clara. How Clara received it was less obvious, but she was inclined to think
                  not very favourably; for though sitting thus apart with him (which probably she
                  might not have been able to prevent) her air was calm and grave. That the young
                  lady at the other end of the bench was doing penance was indubitable. The
                  difference in Miss Denham's countenance, the change from Miss Denham sitting in
                  cold grandeur in Mrs. Parker's drawing room, to be kept from silence by the
                  efforts of others, to Miss Denham at Lady Denham's elbow, listening and talking
                  with smiling attention or solicitous eagerness, was very striking—and very amusing
                  or very melancholy, just as satire or morality might prevail. Miss Denham's
                  character was pretty well decided with Charlotte. <pb n="[b2-30]"/> Sir Edward's
                  required longer observation. He surprised her by quitting Clara immediately on
                  their all joining and agreeing to walk, and by addressing his attentions entirely
                  to herself. Stationing himself close by her, he seemed to mean to detach her as
                  much as possible from the rest of the party and to give her the whole of his
                  conversation. He began, in a tone of great taste and feeling, to talk of the sea
                  and the sea shore; and ran with energy through all the usual phrases employed in
                  praise of their sublimity and descriptive of the <hi rend="italic"
                     >undescribable</hi> emotions they excite in the mind of sensibility. The
                  terrific grandeur of the ocean in a storm, its glass surface in a calm, its gulls
                  and its samphire and the deep fathoms of its abysses, its quick vicissitudes, its
                  direful deceptions, its mariners tempting it in sunshine and overwhelmed by the
                  sudden tempest—all were eagerly and fluently touched; rather commonplace perhaps,
                  but doing very well from the lips of a handsome Sir Edward, and she could not but
                  think him a man of feeling, till he began to <pb n="[b2-31]"/> stagger her by the
                  number of his quotations and the bewilderment of some of his sentences. "Do you
                  remember," said he, "Scott's beautiful lines on the sea? Oh! what a description
                  they convey! They are never out of my thoughts when I walk here. That man who can
                  read them unmoved must have the nerves of an assassin! Heaven defend me from
                  meeting such a man unarmed." "What description do you mean?" said Charlotte. "I
                  remember none at this moment, of the sea, in either of Scott s poems. "Do you not
                  indeed? Nor can I exactly recall the beginning at this moment. But—you cannot have
                  forgotten his description of woman— <hi rend="italic">Oh. Woman in our hours of
                     ease</hi> — Delicious! Delicious! Had he written nothing more, he would have
                  been immortal. And then again, that unequalled, unrivalled address to parental
                  affection— <hi rend="italic"> Some feelings are to mortals given </hi>
                  <hi rend="italic">With less of earth in them than heaven</hi> — <hi rend="italic"
                     >etcetera.</hi> But while we are on the subject of poetry, what think you, Miss
                  Heywood, of Burns's lines to his Mary?” </p>
               <p> “Oh! there is pathos to madden one! If ever there was a man who <hi rend="italic"
                     >felt,</hi> it was Burns. Montgomery has all the fire of poetry, Wordsworth has
                  the true soul of it, <pb n="[b2-32]"/> Campbell in his pleasures of hope has
                  touched the extreme of our sensations— <hi rend="italic"> Like angels' visits, few
                     and far between. </hi> Can you conceive anything more subduing, more melting,
                  more fraught with the deep sublime than that line? But Burns—I confess my sense of
                  his pre-eminence, Miss Heywood. If Scott <hi rend="italic">has a</hi> fault, it is
                  the want of passion. Tender, elegant, descriptive —but <hi rend="italic"
                     >tame.</hi> The man who cannot do justice to the attributes of woman is my
                  contempt. Sometimes indeed a flash of feeling seems to irradiate him, as in the
                  lines we were speaking of— <hi rend="italic">Oh. Woman in our hours of ease</hi> —
                  But Burns is always on fire. His soul was the altar in which lovely woman sat
                  enshrined, his spirit truly breathed the immortal incense which is her due." I
                  have read several of Burns's poems with great delight," said Charlotte as soon as
                  she had time to speak. "But I am not poetic enough to separate a man's poetry
                  entirely from his character; and poor Burns's known irregularities greatly
                  interrupt my enjoyment of his lines. I have difficulty in depending on the <hi
                     rend="italic">truth</hi> of his feelings as a lover. I have not faith in the
                     <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> of the affections of a man of his description.
                  He felt and he wrote and he forgot." <pb n="[b2-33]"/> "Oh! no, no," exclaimed Sir
                  Edward in an ecstasy. "He was all ardour and truth! His genius and his
                  susceptibilities might lead him into some aberrations—but who is perfect? It were
                  hypercriticism, it were pseudo- philosophy to expect from the soul of high-toned
                  genius the grovellings of a common mind. The coruscations of talent, elicited by
                  impassioned feeling in the breast of man, are perhaps incompatible with some of
                  the prosaic decencies of life; nor can you, loveliest Miss Heywood," speaking with
                  an air of deep sentiment, "nor can any woman be a fair judge of what a man may be
                  propelled to say, write or do by the sovereign impulses of illimitable ardour."
                  This was very fine—but if Charlotte understood it at all, not very moral; and
                  being moreover by no means pleased with his extraordinary style of compliment, she
                  gravely answered, "I really know nothing of the matter. This is a charming day.
                  The wind, I fancy, must be southerly." "Happy, happy wind, to engage Miss
                  Heywood's thoughts!" She began to think him downright silly. His choosing to walk
                  with her, she had learnt to understand. It was done to pique Miss Brereton. She
                  had read it, in an anxious glance or two on his side; but why he should <pb
                     n="[b2-34]"/> talk so much nonsense, unless he could do no better, was
                  unintelligible. He seemed very sentimental, very full of some feeling or other,
                  and very much addicted to all the newest-fashioned hard words, had not a very
                  clear brain, she presumed, and talked a good deal by rote. The future might
                  explain him further. But when there was a proposition for going into the library,
                  she felt that she had had quite enough of Sir Edward for one morning and very
                  gladly accepted Lady Denham's invitation of remaining on the Terrace with her. The
                  others all left them, Sir Edward with looks of very gallant despair in tearing
                  himself away, and they united their agreeableness; that is, Lady Denham, like a
                  true great lady, talked and talked only of her own concerns, and Charlotte
                  listened, amused in considering the contrast between her two companions. Certainly
                  there was no strain of doubtful sentiment nor any phrase of difficult
                  interpretation in Lady Denham's discourse. Taking hold of Charlotte's arm with the
                  ease of one who felt that any notice from her was an honour, and communicative
                  from the influence of the same conscious importance <pb n="[b2-35]"/> or a natural
                  love of talking, she immediately said in a tone of great satisfaction and with a
                  look of arch sagacity, "Miss Esther wants me to invite her and her brother to
                  spend a week with me at Sanditon House, as I did last summer. But I shan't. She
                  has been trying to get round me every way with her praise of this and her praise
                  of that; but I saw what she was about. l saw through it all. I am not very easily
                  taken in, my dear." Charlotte could think of nothing more harmless to be said than
                  the simple enquiry of— "Sir Edward and Miss Denham?" "Yes, my dear. My <hi
                     rend="italic">young folks,</hi> as I call them sometimes, for I take them very
                  much by the hand. I had them with me last summer, about this time, for a week;
                  from Monday to Monday; and very delighted and thankful they were. For they are
                  very good young people, my dear. I would not have you think that I <hi
                     rend="italic">only</hi> notice them for poor dear Sir Harry's sake. No, no;
                  they are very deserving themselves or, trust me, they would not be so much in my
                  company. I am not the woman to help anybody blindfold. I always take care to know
                  what I am about and who I have to deal with before I stir a finger. I do not think
                  I was ever over-reached in my life. And that is a good deal for a woman to say
                  that has been married twice. Poor dear Sir <pb n="[b2-36]"/> Harry, between
                  ourselves, thought at first to have got more. But, with a bit of a sigh, he is
                  gone, and we must not find fault with the dead. Nobody could live happier together
                  than us—and he was a very honourable man, quite the gentleman of ancient family.
                  And when he died, I gave Sir Edward his gold watch." She said this with a look at
                  her companion which implied its right to produce a great impression; and seeing no
                  rapturous astonishment in Charlotte s countenance, added quickly, "He did not
                  bequeath it to his nephew, my dear. It was no bequest. It was not in the will. He
                  only told me, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> but once, that he should wish his
                  nephew to have his watch; but it need not have been binding if l had not chose
                  it." "Very kind indeed! Very handsome!" said Charlotte, absolutely forced to
                  affect admiration. "Yes, my dear, and it is not the <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
                  kind thing I have done by him. I have been a very liberal friend to Sir Edward.
                  And poor young man, he needs it bad enough. For though I am <hi rend="italic"
                     >only</hi> the <hi rend="italic">dowager,</hi> my dear, and he is the <hi
                     rend="italic">heir,</hi> things do not stand between us in the way they
                  commonly do between those two parties. Not a shilling do I receive from the Denham
                  estate. Sir Edward has no payments to make <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> He don't
                  stand uppermost, believe me. It is I that help <hi rend="italic">him.</hi>
                  "Indeed! He <pb n="[b2-37]"/> is a very fine young man, particularly elegant in
                  his address." This was said chiefly for the sake of saying something, but
                  Charlotte directly saw that it was laying her open <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                  suspicion by Lady Denham's giving a shrewd glance at her and replying, "Yes, yes,
                  he is very well to look at. And it is to be hoped that some lady of large fortune
                  will think so, for Sir Edward <hi rend="italic">must</hi> marry for money. He and
                  I often talk that matter over. A handsome young fellow like him will go smirking
                  and smiling about and paying girls compliments, but he knows he <hi rend="italic"
                     >must</hi> marry for money. And Sir Edward is a very steady young man in the
                  main and has got very good notions. "Sir Edward Denham," said Charlotte, "with
                  such personal advantages may be almost sure of getting a woman of fortune, if he
                  chooses it." This glorious sentiment seemed quite to remove suspicion. "Aye my
                  dear, that's very sensibly said," cried Lady Denham. "And if we could but get a
                  young heiress to Sanditon! But heiresses are monstrous scarce! I do not think we
                  have had an heiress here—or even a co since Sanditon has been a public place.
                  Families come after families but, as far as I can learn, it is not one in a
                  hundred of them that have any real property, landed or funded. An income perhaps,
                  but no property. Clergymen maybe, or lawyers from town, or half-pay officers, or
                  widows with only a jointure. And what good can such people do <pb n="[b2-38]"/>
                  anybody? Except just as they take our empty houses and, between ourselves, I think
                  they are great fools for not staying at home. Now if we could get a young heiress
                  to be sent here for her health—and if she was ordered to drink asses' milk I could
                  supply her—and, as soon as she got well, have her fall in love with Sir Edward!"
                  "That would be very fortunate indeed." "And Miss Esther must marry somebody of
                  fortune too. She must get a rich husband. Ah, young ladies that have no money are
                  very much to be pitied! But," after a short pause, "if Miss Esther thinks to talk
                  me into inviting them to come and stay at Sanditon House, she will find herself
                  mistaken. Matters are altered with me since last summer, you know. I have Miss
                  Clara with me now which makes a great difference." She spoke this so seriously
                  that Charlotte instantly saw in it the evidence of real penetration and prepared
                  for some fuller remarks; but it was followed only by, "I have no fancy for having
                  my house as full as an hotel. I should not choose to have my two housemaids' time
                  taken up all the morning in dusting out bed rooms. They have Miss Clara's room to
                  put to rights as well as my own every day. If they had hard places, they would
                  want higher wages." For objections of <pb n="[b2-39]"/> this nature, Charlotte was
                  not prepared. She found it so impossible even to affect sympathy that she could
                  say nothing. Lady Denham soon added, with great glee, "And besides all this, my
                  dear, am I to be filling my house to the prejudice of Sanditon? If people want to
                  be by the sea, why don't they take lodgings? Here are a great many empty houses
                  —three on this very Terrace. No fewer than three lodging papers staring me in the
                  face at this very moment, Numbers three, four and eight. Eight, the corner house,
                  may be too large for them, but either of the two others are nice little snug
                  houses, very fit for a young gentleman and his sister. And so, my dear, the next
                  time Miss Esther begins talking about the dampness of Denham park and the good
                  bathing always does her, I shall advise them to come and take one of these
                  lodgings for a fortnight. Don’t you think that will be very fair? Charity begins
                  at home, you know." Charlotte's feelings were divided between amusement and
                  indignation, but indignation had the larger and the increasing share. She kept her
                  countenance and she kept a civil silence. She could not carry her forbearance
                  farther, but without attempting to listen longer, and only conscious that Lady
                  Denham was still talking on in the same way, allowed her thoughts to form <pb
                     n="[b2-40]"/> themselves into such a meditation as this: "She is thoroughly
                  mean. I had not expected anything so bad, Mr. Parker spoke too mildly of her. His
                  judgement is evidently not to be trusted. His own good nature misleads him. He is
                  too kind-hearted to see clearly. I must judge for myself. And their very <hi
                     rend="italic">connection</hi> prejudices him. He has persuaded her to engage in
                  the same speculation, and because their object in that line is the same, he
                  fancies she feels like him in others. But she is very, very mean. l can see no
                  good in her. Poor Miss Brereton! And she makes everybody mean about her. This poor
                  Sir Edward and his sister—how far nature meant them to be respectable I cannot
                  tell—but they are <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to be mean in their servility to
                  her. And I am mean, too, in giving her my attention with the appearance of
                  coinciding with her. Thus it is, when rich people are sordid." </p>

               <p> The two ladies continued walking together till rejoined by the others, who, as
                  they issued from the library, were followed by a young Whitby running off with
                  five volumes under his arm to Sir Edward's gig; <pb n="[b2-41]"/> and Sir Edward,
                  approaching Charlotte, said, "You may perceive what has been our occupation. My
                  sister wanted my counsel in the selection of some books. We have many leisure
                  hours and read a great deal. I am no indiscriminate novel reader. The mere trash
                  of the common circulating library I hold in the highest contempt. You will never
                  hear me advocating those puerile emanations which detail nothing but discordant
                  principles incapable of amalgamation, or those vapid tissues of ordinary
                  occurrences from which no useful deductions can be drawn. In vain may we put them
                  into a literary alembic; we distil nothing which can add to science. You
                  understand me, I am sure?" "I am not quite certain that I do. But if you will
                  describe the sort of novels which you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> approve, I dare
                  say it will give me a clearer idea." Most willingly, fair questioner. The novels
                  which I approve are such as display human nature with grandeur; such as show her
                  in the sublimities of intense feeling; such as exhibit the progress of strong
                  passion from the first germ of incipient susceptibility to the utmost energies of
                  reason half-dethroned; where we see <pb n="[b2-42]"/> the strong spark of woman's
                  captivations elicit such fire in the soul of man as leads him—though at the risk
                  of some aberration from the strict line of primitive obligations—to hazard all,
                  dare all, achieve all to obtain her. Such are the works which I peruse with
                  delight and, I hope I may say, with amelioration. They hold forth the most
                  splendid portraitures of high conceptions, unbounded views, illimitable ardour,
                  indomitable decision. And even when the event is mainly anti-prosperous to the
                  high-toned machinations of the prime character—the potent, pervading hero of the
                  story—it leaves us full of generous emotions for him; our hearts are paralysed. It
                  would be pseudo-philosophy to assert that we do not feel more enwrapped by the
                  brilliancy of his career than by the tranquil and morbid virtues of any opposing
                  character. Our approbation of the latter is but eleemosynary. These are the novels
                  which enlarge the primitive capabilities of the heart; and it cannot impugn the
                  sense or be any dereliction of the character of the most anti-puerile man, to be
                  conversant with.” </p>
               <p> "If I understand you aright," said Charlotte, "our taste in novels is not at all
                  the same." And here they were obliged to part, Miss Denham being much too tired of
                  them all to stay any longer. <pb n="[b2-43]"/> The truth was that Sir Edward, whom
                  circumstances had confined very much to one spot, had read more sentimental novels
                  than agreed with him. His fancy had been early caught by all the impassioned and
                  most exceptionable parts of Richardson's. And such authors as had since appeared
                  to tread in Richardson's steps (so far as man's determined pursuit of woman in
                  defiance of every opposition of feeling and convenience was concerned) had since
                  occupied the greater part of his literary hours, and formed his character. With a
                  perversity of judgement which must be attributed to his not having by nature a
                  very strong head, the graces, the spirit, the sagacity and the perseverance of the
                  villain of the story out-weighed all his absurdities and all his atrocities with
                  Sir Edward. With him such conduct was genius, fire and feeling. It interested and
                  inflamed him. And he was always more anxious for its success, and mourned over its
                  discomfitures with more tenderness, than could ever have been contemplated by the
                  authors. Though he owed many of his ideas to this sort of reading, it would be
                  unjust to say that he read nothing else or that his language was not formed on a
                  more general knowledge of <pb n="[b2-44]"/> modern literature. He read all the
                  essays, letters, tours and criticisms of the day; and with the same ill-luck which
                  made him derive only false principles from lessons of morality, and incentives to
                  vice from the history of its overthrow, he gathered only hard words and involved
                  sentences from the style of our most approved writers. </p>
               <p> Sir Edward's great object in life was to be seductive. With such personal
                  advantages as he knew himself to possess, and such talents as he did also give
                  himself credit for, he regarded it as his duty. He felt that he was formed to be a
                  dangerous man, quite in the line of the Lovelaces. The very name of Sir Edward, he
                  thought, carried some degree of fascination with it. To be generally gallant and
                  assiduous about the fair, to make fine speeches to every pretty girl, was but the
                  inferior part of the character he had to play. Miss Heywood, or any other young
                  woman with any pretensions to beauty, he was entitled (according to his own views
                  of society) to approach with high compliment and rhapsody on the slightest
                  acquaintance. But it was Clara alone on whom he had serious designs; it was Clara
                  whom he meant to seduce—her seduction was quite <pb n="[b2-45]"/> determined on.
                  Her situation in every way called for it. She was his rival in Lady Denham's
                  favour; she was young, lovely and dependent. He had very early seen the necessity
                  of the case, and had now been long trying with cautious assiduity to make an
                  impression on her heart and to undermine her principles. Clara saw through him and
                  had not the least intention of being seduced; but she bore with him patiently
                  enough to confirm the sort of attachment which her personal charms had raised. A
                  greater degree of discouragement indeed would not have affected Sir Edward. He was
                  armed against the highest pitch of disdain or aversion. If she could not be won by
                  affection, he must carry her off. He knew his business. Already had he had many
                  musings on the subject. If he <hi rend="italic">were</hi> constrained so to act,
                  he must naturally wish to strike out something new, to exceed those who had gone
                  before him; and he felt a strong curiosity to ascertain whether the neighbourhood
                  of Timbuctu might not afford some solitary house adapted for Clara's reception.
                  But <pb n="[b2-46]"/> the expense, alas! of measures in that masterly style was
                  ill-suited to his purse; and prudence obliged him to prefer the quietest sort of
                  ruin and disgrace for the object of his affections to the more renowned. </p>

               <p> One day, soon after Charlotte's arrival at Sanditon she had the pleasure of
                  seeing, just as she ascended from the sands to the Terrace, a gentleman's carriage
                  with post horses standing at the door of the hotel, as very lately arrived and by
                  the quantity of luggage being taken off bringing, it might be hoped, some
                  respectable family determined on a long residence. Delighted to have such good
                  news for Mr. and Mrs. Parker, who had both gone home some time before, she
                  proceeded to Trafalgar House with as much alacrity as could remain after having
                  contended for the last two hours with a very fine wind blowing directly on shore.
                  But she had not reached the little lawn when she saw a lady walking nimbly behind
                  her at no great distance; and convinced that it could be no acquaintance of her
                  own, she resolved to hurry on and <pb n="[b2-47]"/> get into the house if possible
                  before her. But the stranger's pace did not allow this to be accomplished.
                  Charlotte was on the steps and had rung but the door was not open when the other
                  crossed the lawn; and when the servant appeared, they were just equally ready for
                  entering the house. The ease of the lady, her "How do you do, Morgan?" and
                  Morgan's looks on seeing her were a moment's astonishment; but another moment
                  brought Mr. Parker into the hall to welcome the sister he had seen from the
                  drawing room; and Charlotte was soon introduced to Miss Diana Parker. There was a
                  great deal of surprise but still more pleasure in seeing her. Nothing could be
                  kinder than her reception from both husband and wife. How did she come? And with
                  whom? And they were so glad to find her equal to the journey! And that she was to
                  belong to <hi rend="italic">them</hi> was taken as a matter of course. Miss Diana
                  Parker was about four and thirty, of middling height and slender; delicate looking
                  rather than sickly; with an agreeable face and a very animated eye; her manners
                  resembling her brother's in their ease and frankness, though with more decision
                  and <pb n="[b2-48]"/> less mildness in her tone. She began an account of herself
                  without delay. Thanking them for their invitation but <hi rend="italic">"that</hi>
                  was quite out of the question for they were all three come and meant to get into
                  lodgings and make some stay." "All three come! What! Susan and Arthur! Susan able
                  to come too! This is better and better." "Yes, we are actually all come. Cite
                  unavoidable. Nothing else to be done. You shall hear all about it. But my dear
                  Mary, send for the children—I long to see them." "And how has Susan borne the
                  journey? And how is Arthur? And why do we not see him here with you?" </p>
               <p> "Susan has borne it wonderfully. She had not a wink of sleep either the night
                  before we set out or last night at Chichester, and as this is not so common with
                  her as with <hi rend="italic">me, I</hi> have had a thousand fears for her. But
                  she has kept up wonderfully—no hysterics of consequence till we came within sight
                  of poor old Sanditon—and the attack was not very violent—nearly over by the time
                  we reached your hotel—so that we got her out of the carriage extremely well with
                  only Mr. Woodcock's assistance. And when I left her she was directing the disposal
                  of the luggage and helping old Sam uncord the trunks. She desired her best love,

               <p> with a thousand regrets at being so poor a creature that she could not come with
                  me. And as for poor Arthur, he would not have been unwilling himself, but there is
                  so much wind that I did not think he could safely venture for I am <hi
                     rend="italic">sure</hi> there is lumbago hanging about him; and so I helped him
                  on with his great coat and sent him off to the Terrace to take us lodgings. Miss
                  Heywood must have seen our carriage standing at the hotel. I knew Miss Heywood the
                  moment I saw her before me on the down. My dear Tom, I am so glad to see you walk
                  so well. Let me feel your ankle. That's right; all right and clean. The play of
                  your sinews a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> little affected, barely perceptible.
                  Well, now for the explanation of my being here. I told you in my letter of the two
                  considerable families I was hoping to secure for you, the West Indians and the
                  seminary." Here Mr. Parker drew his chair still nearer to his sister and took her
                  hand again most affectionately as he <pb n="[b3-2]"/> answered, "Yes, yes, how
                  active and how kind you have been!" "The West Indians," she continued, "whom I
                  look upon as the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> desirable of the two, as the best of
                  the good, prove to be a Mrs. Griffiths and her family. I know them only through
                  others. You must have heard me mention Miss Capper, the particular friend of <hi
                     rend="italic">my</hi> very particular friend Fanny Noyce. Now, Miss Capper is
                  extremely intimate with a Mrs. Darling, who is on terms of constant correspondence
                  with Mrs. Griffiths herself. Only a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> chain, you see,
                  between us, and not a link wanting. Mrs. Griffiths meant to go to the sea for her
                  young people s benefit, had fixed on the coast of Sussex but was undecided as to
                  the where, wanted something private, and wrote to ask the opinion of her friend
                  Mrs. Darling. Miss Capper happened to be staying with Mrs. Darling when Mrs.
                  Griffiths' letter arrived and was consulted on the question. <hi rend="italic"
                     >She</hi> wrote the same day to Fanny Noyce and mentioned it to her; and Fanny,
                  all alive <pb n="[b3-3]"/> for <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> instantly took up her
                  pen and forwarded the circumstance to me—except as to <hi rend="italic"
                     >names,</hi> which have but lately transpired. There was but <hi rend="italic"
                     >one</hi> thing for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to do. I answered Fanny's letter
                  by the same post and pressed for the recommendation of Sanditon. Fanny had feared
                  your having no house large enough to receive such a family. But I seem to be
                  spinning out my story to an endless length. You see how it was all managed. I had
                  the pleasure of hearing soon afterwards by the same simple link of connection that
                  Sanditon <hi rend="italic">had been</hi> recommended by Mrs. Darling, and that the
                  West Indians were very much disposed to go thither. This was the state of the case
                  when I wrote to you. But two days ago— yes, the day before yesterday—I heard again
                  from Fanny Noyce, saying that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had heard from Miss
                  Capper, who by a letter from Mrs. Darling understood that Mrs. Griffiths had
                  expressed herself in a letter to Mrs. Darling more doubtingly on the subject of
                  Sanditon. Am I <pb n="[b3-4]"/> clear? I would be anything rather than not clear."
                  "Oh, perfectly, perfectly. Well? " "The reason of this hesitation was her having
                  no connections in the place, and no means of ascertaining that she should have
                  good accommodations on arriving there; and she was particularly careful and
                  scrupulous on all those matters more on account of a certain Miss Lambe, a young
                  lady—probably a niece—under her care than on her own account or her daughters'.
                  Miss Lambe has an immense fortune—richer than all the rest—and very delicate
                  health. One sees clearly enough by all this the <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> of
                  woman Mrs. Griffiths must be: as helpless and indolent as wealth and a hot climate
                  are apt to make us. But we are not born to equal energy. What was to be done? I
                  had a few moments' indecision, whether to offer to write to you or to Mrs. Whitby
                  to secure them a house; but neither pleased me. I hate to employ others when I am
                  equal to act myself; and my conscience told me that this was an <pb n="[b3-5]"/>
                  occasion which called for me. Here was a family of helpless invalids whom I might
                  essentially serve. I sounded Susan. The same thought had occurred to her. Arthur
                  made no difficulties. Our plan was arranged immediately, we were off yesterday
                  morning at six, left Chichester at the same hour today—and here we are."
                  "Excellent! Excellent!" cried Mr. Parker. "Diana, you are unequalled in serving
                  your friends and doing good to all the world. I know nobody like you. Mary, my
                  love, is not she a wonderful creature? Well, and now, what house do you design to
                  engage for them? What is the size of their family?" "I do not at all know,"
                  replied his sister, "have not the least idea, never heard any particulars; but I
                  am very sure that the largest house at Sanditon cannot be <hi rend="italic"
                     >too</hi> large. They are more likely to want a second. I shall take only one,
                  however, and that but for a week certain. Miss Heywood, I astonish you. You hardly
                  know what to make of me. I see by your looks that <pb n="[b3-6]"/> you are not
                  used to such quick measures." The words "unaccountable officiousness!" "activity
                  run mad!" had just passed through Charlotte's mind, but a civil answer was easy.
                  "I dare say I do look surprised," said she, "because these are very great
                  exertions, and I know what invalids both you and your sister are. "Invalids
                  indeed. I trust there are not three people in England who have so sad a right to
                  that appellation! But my dear Miss Heywood, we are sent into this world to be as
                  extensively useful as possible, and where some degree of strength of mind is
                  given, it is not a feeble body which will excuse us—or incline us to excuse
                  ourselves. The world is pretty much divided between the weak of mind and the
                  strong; between those who can act and those who cannot; and it is the bounden duty
                  of the capable to let no opportunity of being useful escape them. <pb n="[b3-7]"/>
                  My sister's complaints and mine are happily not often of a nature to threaten
                  existence <hi rend="italic">immediately.</hi> And as long as we <hi rend="italic"
                     >can</hi> exert ourselves to be of use to others, I am convinced that the body
                  is the better for the refreshment the mind receives in doing its duty. While I
                  have been travelling with this object in view, I have been perfectly well." The
                  entrance of the children ended this little panegyric on her own disposition; and
                  after having noticed and caressed them all, she prepared to go. "Cannot you dine
                  with us? Is not it possible to prevail on you to dine with us?" was then the cry.
                  And that being absolutely negatived, it was, "And when shall we see you again? And
                  how can we be of use to you?" And Mr. Parker warmly offered his assistance in
                  taking the house for Mrs. Griffiths. "I will come to you the moment I have dined,"
                  said he, "and we will go about together." But this was immediately declined. "No,
                  my dear Tom, upon no account in the world shall you <pb n="[b3-8]"/> stir a step
                  on any business of mine. Your ankle wants rest. I see by the position of your foot
                  that you have used it too much already. No, I shall go about my house-taking
                  directly. Our dinner is not ordered till six; and by that time I hope to have
                  completed it. It is now only half past four. As to seeing <hi rend="italic"
                     >me</hi> again today, I cannot answer for it. The others will be at the hotel
                  all the evening and delighted to see you at any time; but as soon as I get back I
                  shall hear what Arthur has done about our own lodgings, and probably the moment
                  dinner is over shall be out again on business relative to them, for we hope to get
                  into some lodgings or other and be settled after breakfast tomorrow. I have not
                  much confidence in poor Arthur's skill for lodging-taking, but he seemed to like
                  the commission." "I think you are doing too much," said Mr. Parker. "You will
                  knock yourself up. You should not move again after dinner." </p>
               <p> "No, indeed you should not, cried his wife, "for dinner is such a mere <hi
                     rend="italic">name</hi> with you all that <pb n="[b3-9]"/> it can do you no
                  good. I know what your appetites are." "My appetite is very much mended, I assure
                  you, lately. I have been taking some bitters of my own decocting, which have done
                  wonders. Susan never eats, I grant you; and just at present I shall want nothing.
                  I never eat for about a week after a journey. But as for Arthur, he is only too
                  much disposed for food. We are often obliged to check him." "But you have not told
                  me anything of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> family coming to Sanditon," said
                  Mr. Parker as he walked with her to the door of the house. "The Camberwell
                  Seminary. Have we a good chance of <hi rend="italic">them?"</hi>
               </p>
               <p> "Oh, certain. Quite certain. I had forgotten them for the moment. But I had a
                  letter three days ago from my friend Mrs. Charles Dupuis which assured me of
                  Camberwell. Camberwell will be here to a certainty, and very soon. <hi
                     rend="italic">That</hi> good woman— I do not know her name—not being so wealthy
                  and independent as Mrs. Griffiths, can travel and choose for herself. I will tell
                  you how I got at <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> Mrs. Charles Dupuis lives almost next
                  door to a lady, who has a <pb n="[b3-10]"/> relation lately settled at Clapham,
                  who actually attends the seminary and gives lessons on eloquence and belles
                  lettres to some of the girls. I got this man a hare from one of Sidney's friends;
                  and he recommended Sanditon. Without my appearing however—Mrs. Charles Dupuis
                  managed it all." </p>

               <p> It was not a week since Miss Diana Parker had been told by her feelings that the
                  sea air would probably, in her present state, be the death of her; and now she was
                  at Sanditon, intending to make some stay and without appearing to have the
                  slightest recollection of having written or felt any such thing. It was impossible
                  for Charlotte not to suspect a good deal of fancy in such an extraordinary state
                  of health. Disorders and recoveries so very much out of the common way seemed more
                  like the amusement of eager minds in want of employment than of actual afflictions
                  and relief. The Parkers were <pb n="[b3-11]"/> no doubt a family of imagination
                  and quick feelings, and while the eldest brother found vent for his superfluity of
                  sensation as a projector, the sisters were perhaps driven to dissipate theirs in
                  the invention of odd complaints. The <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> of their mental
                  vivacity was evidently not so employed; part was laid out in a zeal for being
                  useful. It would seem that they must either be very busy for the good of others or
                  else extremely ill themselves. </p>
               <p> Some natural delicacy of constitution, in fact, with an unfortunate turn for
                  medicine, especially quack medicine, had given them an early tendency at various
                  times to various disorders; the rest of their sufferings was from fancy, the love
                  of distinction and the love of the wonderful. They had charitable hearts and many
                  amiable feelings; but a spirit of restless activity and the glory of doing more
                  than anybody else had their share in every exertion of benevolence; and there was
                  vanity in all they did, as well as in all they endured. </p>
               <p> Mr. and Mrs. Parker spent a great part of <pb n="[b3-12]"/> the evening at the
                  hotel; but Charlotte had only two or three views of Miss Diana posting over the
                  down after a house for this lady whom she had never seen and who had never
                  employed her. She was not made acquainted with the others till the following day
                  when, being removed into lodgings and all the party continuing quite well, their
                  brother and sister and herself were entreated to drink tea with them. They were in
                  one of the Terrace houses; and she found them arranged for the evening in a small
                  neat drawing room with a beautiful view of the sea if they had chosen it; but
                  though it had been a very fair English summer day, not only was there no open
                  window, but the sofa and the table and the establishment in general was all at the
                  other end of the room by a brisk fire. Miss Parker, whom, remembering the three
                  teeth drawn in one day, Charlotte approached with a peculiar degree of respectful
                  compassion, was not very unlike her sister in person or manner, though more thin
                  and worn by illness and medicine, more relaxed in air and more subdued in voice.
                     <pb n="[b3-13]"/> She talked, however, the whole evening as incessantly as
                  Diana; and excepting that she sat with salts in her hand, took drops two or three
                  times from one out of several phials already at home on the mantelpiece and made a
                  great many odd faces and contortions, Charlotte could perceive no symptoms of
                  illness which she, in the boldness of her own good health, would not have
                  undertaken to cure by putting out the fire, opening the window and disposing of
                  the drops and the salts by means of one or the other. </p>
               <p> She had had considerable curiosity to see Mr. Arthur Parker; and having fancied
                  him a very puny, delicate-looking young man, materially the smallest of a not very
                  robust family, was astonished to find him quite as tall as his brother and a great
                  deal stouter, broad made and lusty, and with no other look of an invalid than a
                  sodden complexion. Diana was evidently the chief of the family—principal mover and
                  actor. She had been on her feet the whole morning, on Mrs. Griffiths' business or
                  their own, and was still the most alert of the three. Susan <pb n="[b3-14]"/> had
                  only superintended their final removal from the hotel, bringing two heavy boxes
                  herself, and Arthur had found the air so cold that he had merely walked from one
                  house to the other as nimbly as he could, and boasted much of sitting by the fire
                  till he had cooked up a very good one. Diana, whose exercise had been too domestic
                  to admit of calculation but who, by her own account, had not once sat down during
                  the space of seven hours, confessed herself a little tired. She had been too
                  successful, however, for much fatigue; for not only had she—by walking and talking
                  down a thousand difficulties—at last secured a proper house at eight guineas per
                  week for Mrs. Griffiths; she had also opened so many treaties with cooks,
                  housemaids, washerwomen and bathing women that Mrs. Griffiths would have little
                  more to do on her arrival than to wave her hand and collect them around her for
                  choice. Her concluding effort in the cause had been a few polite lines of
                  information to Mrs. Griffiths herself, time not allowing for the circuitous train
                  of intelligence which had been hitherto kept up; <pb n="[b3-15]"/> and she was now
                  regaling in the delight of opening the first trenches of an acquaintance with such
                  a powerful discharge of unexpected obligation. Mr. and Mrs. Parker and Charlotte
                  had seen two post chaises crossing the down to the hotel as they were setting off,
                  a joyful sight and full of speculation. The Miss Parkers and Arthur had also seen
                  something; they could distinguish from their window that there <hi rend="italic"
                     >was</hi> an arrival at the hotel, but not its amount. Their visitors answered
                  for two hack chaises. Could it be the Camberwell Seminary? No, no. Had there been
                  a third carriage, perhaps it might; but it was very generally agreed that two hack
                  chaises could never contain a seminary. Mr. Parker was confident of another new
                  family. When they were all finally seated, after some removals to look at the sea
                  and the hotel, Charlotte's place was by Arthur, who was sitting next to the fire
                  with a degree of enjoyment which gave a good deal of merit to his civility in
                  wishing her to take his chair. There was nothing dubious in <pb n="[b3-16]"/> her
                  manner of declining it and he sat down again with much satisfaction. She drew back
                  her chair to have all the advantage of his person as a screen and was very
                  thankful for every inch of back and shoulders beyond her preconceived idea. Arthur
                  was heavy in eye as well as figure but by no means indisposed to talk; and while
                  the other four were chiefly engaged together, he evidently felt it no penance to
                  have a fine young woman next to him, requiring in common politeness some
                  attention; as his brother, who felt the decided want of some motive for action,
                  some powerful object of animation for him, observed with considerable pleasure.
                  Such was the influence of youth and bloom that he began even to make a sort of
                  apology for having a fire. "We should not have had one at home," said he, "but the
                  sea air is always damp. I am not afraid of anything so much as damp." "I am so
                  fortunate," said Charlotte, "as never to know whether the air is damp or dry. It
                  has always some property that is wholesome and invigorating to me." "I like the
                  air too, as well as anybody can," replied Arthur. "I am very fond of standing at
                     <pb n="[b3-17]"/> an open window when there is no wind. But, unluckily, a damp
                  air does not like <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> It gives me the rheumatism. You are
                  not rheumatic, I suppose?" "Not at all." "That's a great blessing. But perhaps you
                  are nervous?" "No, I believe not. I have no idea that I am." "I am very nervous.
                  To say the truth, nerves are the worst part of my complaints in <hi rend="italic"
                     >my</hi> opinion. My sisters think me bilious, but I doubt it." "You are quite
                  in the right to doubt it as long as you possibly can, I am sure." "If I were
                  bilious," he continued, "you know, wine would disagree with me, but it always does
                  me good. The more wine I drink—in moderation—the better I am. I am always best of
                  an evening. If you had seen me today before dinner, you would have thought me a
                  very poor creature. Charlotte could believe it. She kept her countenance, however,
                  and said, "As far as l can understand what nervous complaints are, I have a great
                  idea of the efficacy of air and exercise for them— daily, regular exercise—and I
                  should recommend rather more of it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> than I suspect
                  you are in the habit of taking." "Oh, I am very fond of <pb n="[b3-18]"/> exercise
                  myself," he replied, "and I mean to walk a great deal while I am here, if the
                  weather is temperate. I shall be out every morning before breakfast and take
                  several turns upon the Terrace, and you will often see me at Trafalgar House."
                  "But you do not call a walk to Trafalgar House much exercise?" Not as to mere
                  distance, but the hill is so steep! Walking up that hill, in the middle of the
                  day, would throw me into such a perspiration! You would see me all in a bath by
                  the time I got there! I am very subject to perspiration, and there cannot be a
                  surer sign of nervousness." They were now advancing so deep in physics that
                  Charlotte viewed the entrance of the servant with the tea things as a very
                  fortunate interruption. It produced a great and immediate change. The young man's
                  attentions were instantly lost. He took his own cocoa from the tray, which seemed
                  provided with almost as many teapots as there were persons in company— Miss Parker
                  drinking one sort of herb tea and Miss Diana another —and turning completely to
                  the fire, sat coddling and cooking it to his own satisfaction and <pb n="[b3-19]"
                  /> toasting some slices of bread, brought up ready-prepared in the toast rack; and
                  till it was all done, she heard nothing of his voice but the murmuring of a few
                  broken sentences of self-approbation and success. When his toils were over,
                  however, he moved back his chair into as gallant a line as ever, and proved that
                  he had not been working only for himself by his earnest invitation to her to take
                  both cocoa and toast. She was already helped to tea—which surprised him, so
                  totally self-engrossed had he been. "I thought I should have been in time," said
                  he, "but cocoa rakes a great deal of boiling." "I am much obliged to you," replied
                  Charlotte. "But I <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> tea." "Then I will help myself,"
                  said he. "A large dish of rather Weak cocoa every evening agrees with me better
                  than anything." </p>
               <p> It struck her, however, as he poured out this rather weak cocoa, that it came
                  forth in a very fine, dark-coloured stream; and at the same moment, his sisters
                  both crying out, "Oh, Arthur, you get your cocoa stronger and stronger every
                  evening," with Arthur's somewhat conscious reply of <hi rend="italic">"Tis</hi>
                  rather stronger than it should be tonight," convinced <pb n="[b3-20]"/> her that
                  Arthur was by no means so fond of being starved as they could desire or as he felt
                  proper himself. He was certainly very happy to turn the conversation on dry toast
                  and hear no more of his sisters. "I hope you will eat some of this toast," said
                  he. "I reckon myself a very good toaster. I never burn my toasts, I never put them
                  too near the fire at first. And yet, you see, there is not a corner but what is
                  well browned. I hope you like dry toast. "With a reasonable quantity of butter
                  spread over it, very much," said Charlotte, "but not otherwise. "No more do I,"
                  said he, exceedingly pleased. "We think quite alike there. So far from dry toast
                  being wholesome, I think it a very bad thing for the stomach. Without a little
                  butter to soften it, it hurts the coats of the stomach. I am sure it does. I will
                  have the pleasure of spreading some for you directly, and afterwards I will spread
                  some for myself. Very bad indeed for the coats of the stomach—but there is no
                  convincing <hi rend="italic">some</hi> people. It irritates and acts like a nutmeg
                  grater." He could not get command <pb n="[b3-21]"/> of the butter, however,
                  without a struggle; his sisters accusing him of eating a great deal too much and
                  declaring he was not to be trusted, and he maintaining that he only ate enough to
                  secure the coats of his stomach, and besides, he only wanted it now for Miss
                  Heywood. Such a plea must prevail. He got the butter and spread away for her with
                  an accuracy of judgement which at least delighted himself. But when her toast was
                  done and he took his own in hand, Charlotte could hardly contain herself as she
                  saw him watching his sisters while he scrupulously scraped off almost as much
                  butter as he put on, and then seizing an odd moment for adding a great dab just
                  before it went into his mouth. Certainly, Mr. Arthur Parker's enjoyments in
                  invalidism were very different from his sisters'—by no means so spiritualised. A
                  good deal of earthy dross hung about him. Charlotte could not but suspect him of
                  adopting that line of life principally for the indulgence of an indolent temper,
                  and to be determined on having no disorders but such as called for warm rooms and
                  good nourishment. ln one particular, however, she soon found that he had <pb
                     n="[b3-22]"/> caught something from <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> "What!" said
                  he. "Do you venture upon two dishes of strong green tea in one evening? What
                  nerves you must have! How I envy you. Now, if I were to swallow only one such
                  dish, what do you think its effect would be upon me?" "Keep you awake perhaps all
                  night," replied Charlotte, meaning to overthrow his attempts at surprise by the
                  grandeur of her own conceptions. "Oh, if that were all!" he exclaimed. "No. It
                  acts on me like poison and would entirely take away the use of my right side
                  before I had swallowed it five minutes. It sounds almost incredible, but it has
                  happened to me so often that I cannot doubt it. The use of my right side is
                  entirely taken away for several hours! " "It sounds rather odd to be sure,"
                  answered Charlotte coolly, "but l dare say it would be proved to be the simplest
                  thing in the world by those who have studied right sides and green tea
                  scientifically and thoroughly understand all the possibilities of their action on
                  each other." Soon after tea, a letter was brought to Miss Diana Parker from the
                  hotel. "From Mrs. Charles Dupuis," said she, "some private hand," and having read
                  a few lines, exclaimed aloud, "Well, <pb n="[b3-23]"/> this is very extraordinary!
                  Very extraordinary indeed! That both should have the same name. Two Mrs.
                  Griffiths! This is a letter of recommendation and introduction to me of the lady
                  from Camberwell—and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> name happens to be Griffiths too."
                  A few more lines, however, and the colour rushed into her cheeks and with much
                  perturbation, she added, "The oddest thing that ever was! A Miss Lambe too! A
                  young West Indian of large fortune. But it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be the
                  same. Impossible that it should be the same." She read the letter aloud for
                  comfort. It was merely to introduce the bearer, Mrs. Griffiths from Camberwell,
                  and the three young ladies under her care to Miss Diana Parker's notice. Mrs.
                  Griffiths, being a stranger at Sanditon, was anxious for a respectable
                  introduction; and Mrs. Charles Dupuis, therefore, at the instance of the
                  intermediate friend, provided her with this letter, knowing that she could not do
                  her dear Diana a greater kindness than by giving her the means of being useful.
                  "Mrs. Griffiths' chief solicitude would be for the accommodation and comfort of
                  one of the young ladies under her care, a Miss Lambe, a young West Indian of large
                  fortune in <pb n="[b3-24]"/> delicate health." It was very strange! Very
                  remarkable! Very extraordinary! But they were all agreed in determining it to be
                     <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> that there should not be two families; such a
                  totally distinct set of people as were concerned in the reports of each made that
                  matter quite certain. There <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be two families.
                  Impossible to be otherwise. "Impossible" and "Impossible" were repeated over and
                  over again with great fervour. An accidental resemblance of names and
                  circumstances, however striking at first, involved nothing really incredible; and
                  so it was settled. Miss Diana herself derived an immediate advantage to counter
                  balance her perplexity. She must put her shawl over her shoulders and be running
                  about again. Tired as she was, she must instantly repair to the hotel to
                  investigate the truth and offer her services. </p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head type="main">Chapter 11.</head>
               <p> It would not do. Not all that the whole Parker race could say among themselves
                  could produce a happier catastrophe than that the family from Surrey and the
                  family from Camberwell were one and the same. The rich West Indians and the young
                  ladies' seminary had all entered <pb n="[b3-25]"/> Sanditon in those two hack
                  chaises. The Mrs. Griffiths who, in her friend Mrs. Darling's hands, had wavered
                  as to coming and been unequal to the journey, was the very same Mrs. Griffiths
                  whose plans were at the same period (under another representation) perfectly
                  decided, and who was without fears or difficulties. All that had the appearance of
                  incongruity in the reports of the two might very fairly be placed to the account
                  of the vanity, the ignorance or the blunders of the many engaged in the cause by
                  the vigilance and caution of Miss Diana Parker. <hi rend="italic">Her</hi>
                  intimate friends must be officious like herself; and the subject had supplied
                  letters and extracts and messages enough to make everything appear what it was
                  not. Miss Diana probably felt a little awkward on being first obliged to admit her
                  mistake. A long journey from Hampshire taken for nothing, a brother disappointed,
                  an expensive house on her hands for a week must have been some of her immediate
                  reflections; and much worse than all the rest must have been the sensation of
                  being less clear-sighted and infallible than she had believed herself. No part of
                  it, however, seemed to trouble her for long. There were so many to share in the
                  shame <pb n="[b3-26]"/> and the blame that probably, when she had divided out
                  their proper portions to Mrs. Darling, Miss Capper, Fanny Noyce, Mrs, Charles
                  Dupuis and Mrs. Charles Dupuis's neighbour, there might be a mere trifle of
                  reproach remaining for herself. At any rate, she was seen all the following
                  morning walking about after lodgings with Mrs. Griffiths as alert as ever. Mrs.
                  Griffiths was a very well-behaved, genteel kind of woman, who supported herself by
                  receiving such great girls and young ladies as wanted either masters for finishing
                  their education or a home for beginning their displays. She had several more under
                  her care than the three who were now come to Sanditon, but the others all happened
                  to be absent. Of these three, and indeed of all, Miss Lambe was beyond comparison
                  the most important and precious, as she paid in proportion to her fortune. She was
                  about seventeen, half mulatto, chilly and tender, had a maid of her own, was to
                  have the best room in the lodgings, and was always of the first consequence in
                  every plan of Mrs. Griffiths. The other girls, two Miss Beauforts <pb n="[b3-27]"
                  /> were just such young ladies as may be met with in at least one family out of
                  three throughout the kingdom. They had tolerable complexions, showy figures, an
                  upright decided carriage and an assured look; they were very accomplished and very
                  ignorant, their time being divided between such pursuits as might attract
                  admiration, and those labours and expedients of dexterous ingenuity by which they
                  could dress in a style much beyond what they ought to have afforded; they were
                  some of the first in every change of fashion. And the object of all was to
                  captivate some man of much better fortune than their own. Mrs. Griffiths had
                  preferred a small, retired place like Sanditon on Miss Lambe's account; and the
                  Miss Beauforts, though naturally preferring anything to smallness and retirement,
                  having in the course of the spring been involved in the inevitable expense of six
                  new dresses each for a three-days visit, were constrained to be satisfied with
                  Sanditon also till their circumstances were retrieved. There, with the hire of a
                  harp for one and the purchase of some drawing paper for the other <pb n="[b3-28]"
                  /> and all the finery they could already command, they meant to be very
                  economical, very elegant and very secluded; with the hope, on Miss Beaufort's
                  side, of praise and celebrity from all who walked within the sound of her
                  instrument, and on Miss Letitia's, of curiosity and rapture in all who came near
                  her while she sketched; and to both, the consolation of meaning to be the most
                  stylish girls in the place. The particular introduction of Mrs. Griffiths to Miss
                  Diana Parker secured them immediately an acquaintance with the Trafalgar House
                  family and with the Denhams; and the Miss Beauforts were soon satisfied with "the
                  circle in which they moved in Sanditon," to use a proper phrase, for everybody
                  must now "move in a circle"—to the prevalence of which rotatory motion is perhaps
                  to be attributed the giddiness and false steps of many. Lady Denham had other
                  motives for calling on Mrs. Griffiths besides attention to the Parkers. In Miss
                  Lambe, here was the very young lady, sickly and rich, whom she had been asking
                  for; and she made the acquaintance for Sir Edward's sake <pb n="[b3-29]"/> and the
                  sake of her milch asses. How it might answer with regard to the baronet remained
                  to be proved but, as to the animals, she soon found that all her calculations of
                  profit would be vain. Mrs. Griffiths would not allow Miss Lambe to have the
                  smallest symptom of a decline or any complaint which asses' milk could possibly
                  relieve. Miss Lambe was "under the constant care of an experienced physician," and
                  his prescriptions must be their rule. And except in favour of some tonic pills,
                  which a cousin of her own had a property in, Mrs. Griffiths never deviated from
                  the strict medicinal page. The corner house of the Terrace was the one in which
                  Miss Diana Parker had the pleasure of settling her new friends; and considering
                  that it commanded in front the favourite lounge of all the visitors at Sanditon,
                  and on one side whatever might be going on at the hotel, there could not have been
                  a more favourable spot for the seclusion of the Miss Beauforts. <pb n="[b3-30]"/>
                  And accordingly, long before they had suited themselves with an instrument or with
                  drawing paper, they had, by the frequency of their appearance at the low windows
                  upstairs in order to close the blinds, or open the blinds, to arrange a flower pot
                  on the balcony, or look at nothing through a telescope, attracted many an eye
                  upwards and made many a gazer gaze again. A little novelty has a great effect in
                  so small a place. The Miss Beauforts, who would have been nothing at Brighton,
                  could not move here without notice. And even Mr. Arthur Parker, though little
                  disposed for supernumerary exertion, always quitted the Terrace in his way to his
                  brother's by this corner house for the sake of a glimpse of the Miss
                  Beauforts—though it was half a quarter of a mile round about and added two steps
                  to the ascent of the hill. </p>

               <p> Charlotte had been ten days at Sanditon without seeing Sanditon House, every <pb
                     n="[b3-31]"/> attempt at calling on Lady Denham having been defeated by meeting
                  with her beforehand. But now it was to be more resolutely undertaken, at a more
                  early hour, that nothing might be neglected of attention to Lady Denham or
                  amusement to Charlotte. "And if you should find a favourable opening, my love,"
                  said Mr. Parker, who did not mean to go with them, "I think you had better mention
                  the poor Mullins's situation and sound her Ladyship as to a subscription for them.
                  I am not fond of charitable subscriptions in a place of this kind—it is a sort of
                  tax upon all that come. Yet as their distress is very great and I almost promised
                  the poor woman yesterday to get something done for her, I believe we must set a
                  subscription on foot, and, therefore, the sooner the better; and Lady Denham's
                  name at the head of the list will be a very necessary beginning. You will not
                  dislike speaking to her about it, Mary?" "—I will do whatever you <pb n="[b3-32]"
                  /> wish me," replied his wife, "but you would do it so much better yourself. I
                  shall not know what to say." "My dear Mary," he cried. "It is impossible you can
                  be really at a loss. Nothing can be more simple. You have only to state the
                  present afflicted situation of the family, their earnest application to me, and my
                  being willing to promote a little subscription for their relief, provided it meet
                  with her approbation." "—The easiest thing in the world," cried Miss Diana Parker,
                  who happened to be calling on them at the moment. All said and done in less time
                  than you have been talking of it now. And while you are on the subject of
                  subscriptions, Mary, I will thank you to mention a very melancholy case to Lady
                  Denham which has been represented to me in the most affecting terms. There is a
                  poor woman in Worcestershire, whom some friends of mine are exceedingly interested
                  about, and I have undertaken to collect whatever I can for her. If you would
                  mention the circumstance to Lady Denham! <pb n="[b3-33]"/> Lady Denham <hi
                     rend="italic">can</hi> give, if she is properly attacked. And I look upon her
                  to be the sort of person who, when once she is prevailed on to undraw her purse,
                  would as readily give ten guineas as five. And therefore, if you find her in a
                  giving mood, you might as well speak in favour of another charity which I and a
                  few more have very much at heart—the establishment of a Charitable Repository at
                  Burton on Trent. And then there is the family of the poor man who was hung last
                  assizes at York, though we really <hi rend="italic">have</hi> raised the sum we
                  wanted for putting them all out, yet if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get a
                  guinea from her on their behalf, it may as well be done." "My dear Diana!"
                  exclaimed Mrs. Parker, "I could no more mention these things to Lady Denham than I
                  could fly." "Where's the difficulty? I wish I could go with you myself. But in
                  five minutes I must be at Mrs. Griffiths to encourage Miss Lambe in taking her
                  first dip. She is so frightened, poor thing, <pb n="[b3-34]"/> that I promised to
                  come and keep up her spirits and go in the machine with her if she wished it. And
                  as soon as that is over, I must hurry home, for Susan is to have leeches at one o
                  clock— which will be a three hours' business. Therefore I really have not a moment
                  to spare. Besides that, between ourselves, I ought to be in bed myself at this
                  present time for I am hardly able to stand; and when the leeches have done, I dare
                  say we shall both go to our rooms for the rest of the day." "—I am sorry to hear
                  it, indeed. But if this is the case I hope Arthur will come to us." "—If Arthur
                  takes my advice, he will go to bed too, for if he stays up by himself he will
                  certainly eat and drink more than he ought. But you see, Mary, how impossible it
                  is for me to go with you to Lady Denham's." Upon second thoughts, Mary," said her
                  husband. "I will not trouble you to speak about the Mullinses. I will take an
                  opportunity of seeing Lady Denham myself. I know how little it suits you to be
                  pressing matters upon a mind at <pb n="[b3-35]"/> all unwilling." <hi
                     rend="italic">His</hi> application thus withdrawn, his sister could say no more
                  in support of hers, which was his object, as he felt all their impropriety and all
                  the certainty of their ill effect upon his own better claim. Mrs. Parker was
                  delighted at this release and set off very happy with her friend and her little
                  girl on this walk to Sanditon House. It was a close, misty morning and, when they
                  reached the brow of the hill, they could not for some time make out what sort of
                  carriage it was which they saw coming up. It appeared at different moments to be
                  everything from a gig to a phaeton, from one horse to four; and just as they were
                  concluding in favour of a tandem, little Mary's young eyes distinguished the
                  coachman and she eagerly called out, "It is Uncle Sidney, Mama, it is indeed." And
                  so it proved. Mr. Sidney Parker, driving his servant in a very neat carriage, was
                  soon opposite to them, and they all stopped for a few minutes. The manners of the
                  Parkers were always pleasant among themselves; and it was a very friendly meeting
                  between Sidney <pb n="[b3-36]"/> and his sister-in-law, who was most kindly taking
                  it for granted that he was on his way to Trafalgar House. This he declined,
                  however. He was "just come from Eastbourne proposing to spend two or three days,
                  as it might happen, at Sanditon"; but the hotel must be his quarters. He was
                  expecting to be joined there by a friend or two. The rest was common enquiries and
                  remarks, with kind notice of little Mary, and a very well-bred bow and proper
                  address to Miss Heywood on her being named to him. And they parted to meet again
                  within a few hours. Sidney Parker was about seven or eight and twenty, very
                  good-looking, with a decided air of ease and fashion and a lively countenance.
                  This adventure afforded agreeable discussion for some time. Mrs. Parker entered
                  into all her husband's joy on the occasion and exulted in the credit which
                  Sidney's arrival would give to the place. The road to Sanditon House was a broad,
                  handsome, planted approach between fields, leading at the end of a quarter of a
                  mile through second gates into grounds which, though not extensive, <pb
                     n="[b3-37]"/> had all the beauty and respectability which an abundance of very
                  fine timber could give. These entrance gates were so much in a corner of the
                  grounds or paddock, so near to one of its boundaries, that an outside fence was at
                  first almost pressing on the road, till an angle <hi rend="italic">here</hi> and a
                  curve <hi rend="italic">there</hi> threw them to a better distance. The fence was
                  a proper park paling in excellent condition, with clusters of fine elms or rows of
                  old thorns following its line almost everywhere. <hi rend="italic">Almost</hi>
                  must be stipulated, for there were vacant spaces, and through one of these,
                  Charlotte, as soon as they entered the enclosure, caught a glimpse over the pales
                  of something white and womanish in the field on the other side. It was something
                  which immediately brought Miss Brereton into her head; and stepping to the pales,
                  she saw indeed—and very decidedly, in spite of the mist—Miss Brereton seated not
                  far before her at the foot of the bank which sloped down from the outside of the
                  paling and which a narrow path seemed to skirt along—Miss Brereton seated,
                  apparently very composedly, and Sir <pb n="[b3-38]"/> Edward Denham by her side.
                  They were sitting so near each other and appeared so closely engaged in gentle
                  conversation that Charlotte instantly felt she had nothing to do but to step back
                  again and say not a word. privacy was certainly their object. lt could not but
                  strike her rather unfavourably with regard to Clara; but hers was a situation
                  which must not be judged with severity. She was glad to perceive that nothing had
                  been discerned by Mrs. Parker. If Charlotte had not been considerably the taller
                  of the two, Miss Brereton's white ribbons might not have fallen within the ken of
                     <hi rend="italic">her</hi> more observant eyes. Among other points of
                  moralising reflection which the sight of this tete-a-tete produced, Charlotte
                  could not but think of the extreme difficulty which secret lovers must have in
                  finding a proper spot for their stolen interviews. Here perhaps they had thought
                  themselves so perfectly secure from observation —the whole field open before them;
                  a steep bank and pales never crossed by the foot of man at their back, and a great
                  thickness <pb n="[b3-39]"/> of air to aid them as well! Yet here she had seen
                  them. They were really ill-used. The house was large and handsome. Two servants
                  appeared to admit them and everything had a suitable air of property and order,
                  Lady Denham valued herself upon her liberal establishment and had great enjoyment
                  in the order and importance of her style of living. They were shown into the usual
                  sitting room, well proportioned and well furnished, though it was furniture rather
                  originally good and extremely well kept than new or showy. And as Lady Denham was
                  not there, Charlotte had leisure to look about her and to be told by Mrs. Parker
                  that the whole-length portrait of a stately gentleman which, placed over the
                  mantelpiece, caught the eye immediately, was the picture of Sir Henry Denham; and
                  that one among many miniatures in another part of the room, little conspicuous,
                  represented Mr. Hollis. Poor Mr. Hollis! It was impossible not to feel him hardly
                  used: to be obliged to stand back in his own house and see the best place by the
                     <pb n="[b3-40]"/> fire constantly occupied by Sir Henry Denham. </p>
