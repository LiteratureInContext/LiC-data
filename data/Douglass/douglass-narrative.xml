            <!--I've made some slight alterations to the original etext center markup. These are:
                
            1) Throughout the original markup is the string &emdash; to indicate where Douglass (liberally)
            uses em dashes. I have done a simple find and replace to substitute these with actual em dashes,
            since TEI supports this character without any issues.
            2) The <div> elements were listed in the original markup as <div1>. I have simply updated them to <div>.
            3) <div> elements with the type="chapter" attribute came with an id attribute that invalidated the TEI file.
            I have deleted them. You can find them easily enough in the original etext markup, if it turns out these were
            important.
            
            I hope this helps! -austin benson

                <lb/>
                <p>In the month of August, 1841, I attended an anti-<lb/> slavery convention in
                    Nantucket, at which it was<lb/> my happiness to become acquainted with
                    FREDERICK<lb/> DOUGLASS, the writer of the following Narrative. He<lb/> was a
                    stranger to nearly every member of that body;<lb/> but, having recently made his
                    escape from the south-<lb/> ern prison-house of bondage, and feeling his
                    curiosity<lb/> excited to ascertain the principles and measures of<lb/> the
                    abolitionists,â€” of whom he had heard a somewhat<lb/> vague description
                    while he was a slave,â€” he was in-<lb/> duced to give his attendance, on
                    the occasion al-<lb/> luded to, though at that time a resident in New<lb/>
                    Bedford.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Fortunate, most fortunate occurrence!â€” fortunate<lb/> for the millions of
                    his manacled brethren, yet pant-<lb/> ing for deliverance from their awful
                    thraldom!â€” for-<lb/> tunate for the cause of negro emancipation, and
                    of<lb/> universal liberty!â€” fortunate for the land of his birth,<lb/>
                    which he has already done so much to save and bless!<lb/>â€” fortunate for
                    a large circle of friends and acquaint-<lb/> ances, whose sympathy and affection
                    he has strongly<lb/> secured by the many sufferings he has endured, by<lb/> his
                    virtuous traits of character, by his ever-abiding<lb/> remembrance of those who
                    are in bonds, as being<lb/> bound with them!â€” fortunate for the
                    multitudes, in<lb/> various parts of our republic, whose minds he has<lb/>
                    enlightened on the subject of slavery, and who have<lb/> been melted to tears by
                    his pathos, or roused to<lb/> virtuous indignation by his stirring eloquence
                    against<lb/> the enslavers of men!â€” fortunate for himself, as<lb/>
                    <pb n="x"/> it at once brought him into the field of public use-<lb/> fulness,
                    "gave the world assurance of a MAN," quick-<lb/> ened the slumbering energies of
                    his soul, and con-<lb/> secrated him to the great work of breaking the rod<lb/>
                    of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I shall never forget his first speech at the conven-<lb/> tionâ€” the
                    extraordinary emotion it excited in my own<lb/> mindâ€” the powerful
                    impression it created upon a<lb/> crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise
                   â€” the<lb/> applause which followed from the beginning to the<lb/> end of
                    his felicitous remarks. I think I never hated<lb/> slavery so intensely as at
                    that moment; certainly, my<lb/> perception of the enormous outrage which is
                    in-<lb/> flicted by it, on the godlike nature of its victims, was<lb/> rendered
                    far more clear than ever. There stood one,<lb/> in physical proportion and
                    stature commanding and<lb/> exactâ€” in intellect richly endowedâ€” in
                    natural elo-<lb/> quence a prodigyâ€” in soul manifestly "created but
                    a<lb/> little lower than the angels"â€” yet a slave, ay, a fugi-<lb/> tive
                    slave,â€” trembling for his safety, hardly daring to<lb/> believe that on
                    the American soil, a single white<lb/> person could be found who would befriend
                    him at<lb/> all hazards, for the love of God and humanity! Ca-<lb/> pable of
                    high attainments as an intellectual and<lb/> moral beingâ€” needing nothing
                    but a comparatively<lb/> small amount of cultivation to make him an orna-<lb/>
                    ment to society and a blessing to his raceâ€” by the law<lb/> of the land,
                    by the voice of the people, by the terms<lb/> of the slave code, he was only a
                    piece of property, a<lb/> beast of burden, a chattel personal,
                    nevertheless!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>A beloved friend from New Bedford prevailed on<lb/> Mr. DOUGLASS to address the
                    convention: He came<lb/> forward to the platform with a hesitancy and
                    embar-<lb/> rassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive<lb/> mind in
                    such a novel position. After apologizing for<lb/> his ignorance, and reminding
                    the audience that slav-<lb/> ery was a poor school for the human intellect and<lb/>
                    <pb n="xi"/> heart, he proceeded to narrate some of the facts in<lb/> his own
                    history as a slave, and in the course of his<lb/> speech gave utterance to many
                    noble thoughts and<lb/> thrilling reflections. As soon as he had taken his<lb/>
                    seat, filled with hope and admiration, I rose, and<lb/> declared that PATRICK
                    HENRY, of revolutionary fame,<lb/> never made a speech more eloquent in the
                    cause of<lb/> liberty, than the one we had just listened to from<lb/> the lips
                    of that hunted fugitive. So I believed at<lb/> that timeâ€” such is my
                    belief now. I reminded the<lb/> audience of the peril which surrounded this
                    self-<lb/> emancipated young man at the North,â€” even in Mas-<lb/>
                    sachusetts, on the soil of the Pilgrim Fathers, among<lb/> the descendants of
                    revolutionary sires; and I ap-<lb/> pealed to them, whether they would ever
                    allow him<lb/> to be carried back into slavery,â€” law or no law, con-<lb/>
                    stitution or no constitution. The response was unani-<lb/> mous and in
                    thunder-tonesâ€” "NO!" "Will you succor<lb/> and protect him as a
                    brother-manâ€” a resident of the<lb/> old Bay State?" "YES!" shouted the
                    whole mass,<lb/> with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants<lb/>
                    south of Mason and Dixon's line might almost have<lb/> heard the mighty burst of
                    feeling, and recognized<lb/> it as the pledge of an invincible determination,
                    on<lb/> the part of those who gave it, never to betray him<lb/> that wanders,
                    but to hide the outcast, and firmly to<lb/> abide the consequences.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind,<lb/> that, if Mr. DOUGLASS could be
                    persuaded to conse-<lb/> crate his time and talents to the promotion of the<lb/>
                    anti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would<lb/> be given to it, and a
                    stunning blow at the same time<lb/> inflicted on northern prejudice against a
                    colored<lb/> complexion. I therefore endeavored to instil hope<lb/> and courage
                    into his mind, in order that he might<lb/> dare to engage in a vocation so
                    anomalous and re-<lb/> sponsible for a person in his situation; and I was<lb/>
                    <pb n="xii"/> seconded in this effort by warm-hearted friends, es-<lb/> pecially
                    by the late General Agent of the Massa-<lb/> chusetts Anti-Slavery Society, Mr.
                    JOHN A. COLLINS,<lb/> whose judgment in this instance entirely coincided<lb/>
                    with my own. At first, he could give no encourage-<lb/> ment; with unfeigned
                    diffidence, he expressed his<lb/> conviction that he was not adequate to the
                    perform-<lb/> ance of so great a task; the path marked out was<lb/> wholly an
                    untrodden one; he was sincerely appre-<lb/> hensive that he should do more harm
                    than good.<lb/> After much deliberation, however, he consented to<lb/> make a
                    trial; and ever since that period, he has acted<lb/> as a lecturing agent, under
                    the auspices either of the<lb/> American or the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery
                    Society.<lb/> In labors he has been most abundant; and his success<lb/> in
                    combating prejudice, in gaining proselytes, in agi-<lb/> tating the public mind,
                    has far surpassed the most<lb/> sanguine expectations that were raised at the
                    com-<lb/> mencement of his brilliant career. He has borne him-<lb/> self with
                    gentleness and meekness, yet with true<lb/> manliness of character. As a public
                    speaker, he excels<lb/> in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of<lb/>
                    reasoning, and fluency of language. There is in him<lb/> that union of head and
                    heart, which is indispensable<lb/> to an enlightenment of the heads and a
                    winning of<lb/> the hearts of others. May his strength continue to<lb/> be equal
                    to his day! May he continue to "grow in<lb/> grace, and in the knowledge of
                    God," that he may<lb/> be increasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding<lb/>
                    humanity, whether at home or abroad!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>It is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of<lb/> the most efficient
                    advocates of the slave population,<lb/> now before the public, is a fugitive
                    slave, in the<lb/> person of FREDERICK DOUGLASS; and that the free<lb/> colored
                    population of the United States are as ably<lb/> represented by one of their own
                    number, in the per-<lb/> son of CHARLES LENOX REMOND, whose eloquent<lb/>
                    <pb n="xiii"/> appeals have extorted the highest applause of multi-<lb/> tudes
                    on both sides of the Atlantic. Let the calum-<lb/> niators of the colored race
                    despise themselves for<lb/> their baseness and illiberality of spirit, and
                    hence-<lb/> forth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those<lb/> who
                    require nothing but time and opportunity to<lb/> attain to the highest point of
                    human excellence.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>It may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any<lb/> other portion of the
                    population of the earth could<lb/> have endured the privations, sufferings and
                    horrors<lb/> of slavery, without having become more degraded<lb/> in the scale
                    of humanity than the slaves of African<lb/> descent. Nothing has been left
                    undone to cripple<lb/> their intellects, darken their minds, debase their<lb/>
                    moral nature, obliterate all traces of their relation-<lb/> ship to mankind; and
                    yet how wonderfully they have<lb/> sustained the mighty load of a most frightful
                    bond-<lb/> age, under which they have been groaning for cen-<lb/> turies! To
                    illustrate the effect of slavery on the white<lb/> man,â€” to show that he
                    has no powers of endurance,<lb/> in such a condition, superior to those of his
                    black<lb/> brother,â€” DANIEL O'CONNELL, the distinguished<lb/> advocate of
                    universal emancipation, and the mighti-<lb/> est champion of prostrate but not
                    conquered Ireland,<lb/> relates the following anecdote in a speech
                    delivered<lb/> by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the<lb/> Loyal
                    National Repeal Association, March 31, 1845.<lb/> "No matter," said Mr.
                    O'CONNELL, "under what<lb/> specious term it may disguise itself, slavery is
                    still<lb/> hideous. IT HAS A NATURAL, AN INEVITABLE TENDENCY TO<lb/> BRUTALIZE
                    EVERY NOBLE FACULTY OF MAN. An American<lb/> sailor, who was cast away on the
                    shore of Africa,<lb/> where he was kept in slavery for three years, was, at<lb/>
                    the expiration of that period, found to be imbruted<lb/> and stultifiedâ€”
                    he had lost all reasoning power; and<lb/> having forgotten his native language,
                    could only ut-<lb/> ter some savage gibberish between Arabic and Eng-<lb/>
                    <pb n="xiv"/> lish, which nobody could understand, and which<lb/> even he
                    himself found difficulty in pronouncing. So<lb/> much for the humanizing
                    influence of THE DOMESTIC<lb/> INSTITUTION!" Admitting this to have been an
                    ex-<lb/> traordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at<lb/> least that
                    the white slave can sink as low in the<lb/> scale of humanity as the black
                    one.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. DOUGLASS has very properly chosen to write<lb/> his own Narrative, in his own
                    style, and according<lb/> to the best of his ability, rather than to employ
                    some<lb/> one else. It is, therefore, entirely his own produc-<lb/> tion; and,
                    considering how long and dark was the ca-<lb/> reer he had to run as a slave,
                   â€” how few have been his<lb/> opportunities to improve his mind since he
                    broke his<lb/> iron fetters,â€” it is, in my judgment, highly
                    creditable<lb/> to his head and heart. He who can peruse it without<lb/> a
                    tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,â€”<lb/> without being
                    filled with an unutterable abhorrence<lb/> of slavery and all its abettors, and
                    animated with a<lb/> determination to seek the immediate overthrow of<lb/> that
                    execrable system,â€” without trembling for the<lb/> fate of this country in
                    the hands of a righteous God,<lb/> who is ever on the side of the oppressed, and
                    whose<lb/> arm is not shortened that it cannot save,â€” must have<lb/> a
                    flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a<lb/> trafficker "in slaves
                    and the souls of men." I am con-<lb/> fident that it is essentially true in all
                    its statements;<lb/> that nothing has been set down in malice, nothing<lb/>
                    exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination;<lb/> that it comes short of the
                    reality, rather than over-<lb/> states a single fact in regard to SLAVERY AS IT
                    IS.<lb/> The experience of FREDERICK DOUGLASS, as a slave,<lb/> was not a
                    peculiar one; his lot was not especially<lb/> a hard one; his case may be
                    regarded as a very fair<lb/> specimen of the treatment of slaves in Maryland,
                    in<lb/> which State it is conceded that they are better fed<lb/> and less
                    cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama,<lb/>
                    <pb n="xv"/> or Louisiana. Many have suffered incomparably<lb/> more, while very
                    few on the plantations have suf-<lb/> fered less, than himself. Yet how
                    deplorable was his<lb/> situation! what terrible chastisements were
                    inflicted<lb/> upon his person! what still more shocking outrages<lb/> were
                    perpetrated upon his mind! with all his noble<lb/> powers and sublime
                    aspirations, how like a brute<lb/> was he treated, even by those professing to
                    have the<lb/> same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus! to what<lb/> dreadful
                    liabilities was he continually subjected! how<lb/> destitute of friendly counsel
                    and aid, even in his<lb/> greatest extremities! how heavy was the midnight
                    of<lb/> woe which shrouded in blackness the last ray of hope,<lb/> and filled
                    the future with terror and gloom! what<lb/> longings after freedom took
                    possession of his breast,<lb/> and how his misery augmented, in proportion as
                    he<lb/> grew reflective and intelligent,â€” thus demonstrating<lb/> that a
                    happy slave is an extinct man! how he<lb/> thought, reasoned, felt, under the
                    lash of the driver,<lb/> with the chains upon his limbs! what perils he en-<lb/>
                    countered in his endeavors to escape from his hor-<lb/> rible doom! and how
                    signal have been his deliverance<lb/> and preservation in the midst of a nation
                    of pitiless<lb/> enemies!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>This Narrative contains many affecting incidents,<lb/> many passages of great
                    eloquence and power; but I<lb/> think the most thrilling one of them all is the
                    de-<lb/> scription DOUGLASS gives of his feelings, as he stood<lb/>
                    soliloquizing respecting his fate, and the chances of<lb/> his one day being a
                    freeman, on the banks of the<lb/> Chesapeake Bayâ€” viewing the receding
                    vessels as they<lb/> flew with their white wings before the breeze, and<lb/>
                    apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit<lb/> of freedom. Who can
                    read that passage, and be in-<lb/> sensible to its pathos and sublimity?
                    Compressed<lb/> into it is a whole Alexandrian library of thought,<lb/> feeling,
                    and sentimentâ€” all that can, all that need be<lb/>
                    <pb n="xvi"/> urged, in the form of expostulation, entreaty, rebuke,<lb/>
                    against that crime of crimes,â€” making man the prop-<lb/> erty of his
                    fellow-man! O, how accursed is that<lb/> system, which entombs the godlike mind
                    of man,<lb/> defaces the divine image, reduces those who by crea-<lb/> tion were
                    crowned with glory and honor to a level<lb/> with four-footed beasts, and exalts
                    the dealer in hu-<lb/> man flesh above all that is called God! Why should<lb/>
                    its existence be prolonged one hour? Is it not evil,<lb/> only evil, and that
                    continually? What does its pres-<lb/> ence imply but the absence of all fear of
                    God, all<lb/> regard for man, on the part of the people of the<lb/> United
                    States? Heaven speed its eternal overthrow!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>So profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery<lb/> are many persons, that they
                    are stubbornly incredu-<lb/> lous whenever they read or listen to any recital
                    of<lb/> the cruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims.<lb/> They do not
                    deny that the slaves are held as prop-<lb/> erty; but that terrible fact seems
                    to convey to their<lb/> minds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or<lb/>
                    savage barbarity. Tell them of cruel scourgings, of<lb/> mutilations and
                    brandings, of scenes of pollution<lb/> and blood, of the banishment of all light
                    and knowl-<lb/> edge, and they affect to be greatly indignant at such<lb/>
                    enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstate-<lb/> ments, such abominable
                    libels on the character of<lb/> the southern planters! As if all these direful
                    outrages<lb/> were not the natural results of slavery! As if it were<lb/> less
                    cruel to reduce a human being to the condition<lb/> of a thing, than to give him
                    a severe flagellation,<lb/> or to deprive him of necessary food and
                    clothing!<lb/> As if whips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, blood-<lb/> hounds,
                    overseers, drivers, patrols, were not all in-<lb/> dispensable to keep the
                    slaves down, and to give<lb/> protection to their ruthless oppressors! As if,
                    when<lb/> the marriage institution is abolished, concubinage,<lb/> adultery, and
                    incest, must not necessarily abound;<lb/>
                    <pb n="xvii"/> when all the rights of humanity are annihilated, any<lb/> barrier
                    remains to protect the victim from the fury<lb/> of the spoiler; when absolute
                    power is assumed over<lb/> life and liberty, it will not be wielded with
                    destruc-<lb/> tive sway! Skeptics of this character abound in so-<lb/> ciety. In
                    some few instances, their incredulity arises<lb/> from a want of reflection;
                    but, generally, it indicates<lb/> a hatred of the light, a desire to shield
                    slavery from<lb/> the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored<lb/> race,
                    whether bond or free. Such will try to discredit<lb/> the shocking tales of
                    slaveholding cruelty which are<lb/> recorded in this truthful Narrative; but
                    they will<lb/> labor in vain. Mr. DOUGLASS has frankly disclosed<lb/> the place
                    of his birth, the names of those who<lb/> claimed ownership in his body and
                    soul, and the<lb/> names also of those who committed the crimes which<lb/> he
                    has alleged against them. His statements, there-<lb/> fore, may easily be
                    disproved, if they are untrue.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In the course of his Narrative, he relates two in-<lb/> stances of murderous
                    cruelty,â€” in one of which a<lb/> planter deliberately shot a slave
                    belonging to a neigh-<lb/> boring plantation, who had unintentionally
                    gotten<lb/> within his lordly domain in quest of fish; and in the<lb/> other, an
                    overseer blew out the brains of a slave who<lb/> had fled to a stream of water
                    to escape a bloody<lb/> scourging. Mr. DOUGLASS states that in neither of<lb/>
                    these instances was any thing done by way of legal<lb/> arrest or judicial
                    investigation. The Baltimore Amer-<lb/> ican, of March 17, 1845, relates a
                    similar case of<lb/> atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunityâ€” as
                    fol-<lb/> lows:â€” "SHOOTING A SLAVE.â€” We learn, upon the au-<lb/>
                    thority of a letter from Charles county, Maryland,<lb/> received by a gentleman
                    of this city, that a young<lb/> man, named Matthews, a nephew of General
                    Mat-<lb/> thews, and whose father, it is believed, holds an of-<lb/> fice at
                    Washington, killed one of the slaves upon his<lb/> father's farm by shooting
                    him. The letter states that<lb/>
                    <pb n="xviii"/> young Matthews had been left in charge of the farm;<lb/> that he
                    gave an order to the servant, which was dis-<lb/> obeyed, when he proceeded to
                    the house, OBTAINED<lb/> A GUN, AND, RETURNING, SHOT THE SERVANT. He
                    immedi-<lb/> ately, the letter continues, fled to his father's resi-<lb/> dence,
                    where he still remains unmolested."â€” Let it<lb/> never be forgotten, that
                    no slaveholder or overseer<lb/> can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on
                    the<lb/> person of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on<lb/> the testimony
                    of colored witnesses, whether bond<lb/> or free. By the slave code, they are
                    adjudged to be<lb/> as incompetent to testify against a white man, as<lb/>
                    though they were indeed a part of the brute creation.<lb/> Hence, there is no
                    legal protection in fact, whatever<lb/> there may be in form, for the slave
                    population; and<lb/> any amount of cruelty may be inflicted on them<lb/> with
                    impunity. Is it possible for the human mind<lb/> to conceive of a more horrible
                    state of society?<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The effect of a religious profession on the conduct<lb/> of southern masters is
                    vividly described in the fol-<lb/> lowing Narrative, and shown to be any thing
                    but<lb/> salutary. In the nature of the case, it must be in<lb/> the highest
                    degree pernicious. The testimony of Mr.<lb/> DOUGLASS, on this point, is
                    sustained by a cloud of<lb/> witnesses, whose veracity is unimpeachable. "A
                    slave-<lb/> holder's profession of Christianity is a palpable im-<lb/> posture.
                    He is a felon of the highest grade. He is a<lb/> man-stealer. It is of no
                    importance what you put in<lb/> the other scale."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Reader! are you with the man-stealers in sympathy<lb/> and purpose, or on the
                    side of their down-trodden<lb/> victims? If with the former, then are you the
                    foe of<lb/> God and man. If with the latter, what are you pre-<lb/> pared to do
                    and dare in their behalf? Be faithful,<lb/> be vigilant, be untiring in your
                    efforts to break every<lb/> yoke, and let the oppressed go free. Come what

                <p> LETTER<lb/> FROM WENDELL PHILLIPS, ESQ.<lb/> BOSTON, APRIL 22, 1845.<lb/> My
                    Dear Friend:<lb/> You remember the old fable of "The Man and<lb/> the Lion,"
                    where the lion complained that he should<lb/> not be so misrepresented "when the
                    lions wrote his-<lb/> tory."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I am glad the time has come when the "lions<lb/> write history." We have been
                    left long enough to<lb/> gather the character of slavery from the
                    involuntary<lb/> evidence of the masters. One might, indeed, rest<lb/>
                    sufficiently satisfied with what, it is evident, must<lb/> be, in general, the
                    results of such a relation, with-<lb/> out seeking farther to find whether they
                    have fol-<lb/> lowed in every instance. Indeed, those who stare at<lb/> the
                    half-peck of corn a week, and love to count the<lb/> lashes on the slave's back,
                    are seldom the "stuff" out<lb/> of which reformers and abolitionists are to be
                    made.<lb/> I remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for<lb/> the results of
                    the West India experiment, before<lb/> they could come into our ranks. Those
                    "results" have<lb/> come long ago; but, alas! few of that number have<lb/> come
                    with them, as converts. A man must be dis-<lb/> posed to judge of emancipation
                    by other tests than<lb/> whether it has increased the produce of sugar,â€”
                    and<lb/> to hate slavery for other reasons than because it<lb/> starves men and
                    whips women,â€” before he is ready<lb/> to lay the first stone of his
                    anti-slavery life.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was glad to learn, in your story, how early the<lb/> most neglected of God's
                    children waken to a sense<lb/> of their rights, and of the injustice done them. Ex-<lb/>
                    <pb n="xxii"/> perience is a keen teacher; and long before you had<lb/> mastered
                    your A B C, or knew where the "white<lb/> sails" of the Chesapeake were bound,
                    you began, I<lb/> see, to gauge the wretchedness of the slave, not by<lb/> his
                    hunger and want, not by his lashes and toil, but<lb/> by the cruel and blighting
                    death which gathers over<lb/> his soul.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In connection with this, there is one circumstance<lb/> which makes your
                    recollections peculiarly valuable,<lb/> and renders your early insight the more
                    remarkable.<lb/> You come from that part of the country where we<lb/> are told
                    slavery appears with its fairest features. Let<lb/> us hear, then, what it is at
                    its best estateâ€” gaze on<lb/> its bright side, if it has one; and then
                    imagination<lb/> may task her powers to add dark lines to the picture,<lb/> as
                    she travels southward to that (for the colored<lb/> man) Valley of the Shadow of
                    Death, where the<lb/> Mississippi sweeps along.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Again, we have known you long, and can put the<lb/> most entire confidence in
                    your truth, candor, and<lb/> sincerity. Every one who has heard you speak
                    has<lb/> felt, and, I am confident, every one who reads your<lb/> book will
                    feel, persuaded that you give them a fair<lb/> specimen of the whole truth. No
                    one-sided portrait,<lb/>â€” no wholesale complaints,â€” but strict
                    justice done,<lb/> whenever individual kindliness has neutralized, for<lb/> a
                    moment, the deadly system with which it was<lb/> strangely allied. You have been
                    with us, too, some<lb/> years, and can fairly compare the twilight of
                    rights,<lb/> which your race enjoy at the North, with that "noon<lb/> of night"
                    under which they labor south of Mason<lb/> and Dixon's line. Tell us whether,
                    after all, the half-<lb/> free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off
                    than<lb/> the pampered slave of the rice swamps!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In reading your life, no one can say that we have<lb/> unfairly picked out some
                    rare specimens of cruelty.<lb/> We know that the bitter drops, which even you have<lb/>
                    <pb n="xxiii"/> drained from the cup, are no incidental aggravations,<lb/> no
                    individual ills, but such as must mingle always<lb/> and necessarily in the lot
                    of every slave. They are the<lb/> essential ingredients, not the occasional
                    results, of<lb/> the system.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>After all, I shall read your book with trembling<lb/> for you. Some years ago,
                    when you were beginning<lb/> to tell me your real name and birthplace, you
                    may<lb/> remember I stopped you, and preferred to remain<lb/> ignorant of all.
                    With the exception of a vague de-<lb/> scription, so I continued, till the other
                    day, when<lb/> you read me your memoirs. I hardly knew, at the<lb/> time,
                    whether to thank you or not for the sight of<lb/> them, when I reflected that it
                    was still dangerous,<lb/> in Massachusetts, for honest men to tell their
                    names!<lb/> They say the fathers, in 1776, signed the Declaration<lb/> of
                    Independence with the halter about their necks.<lb/> You, too, publish your
                    declaration of freedom with<lb/> danger compassing you around. In all the broad
                    lands<lb/> which the Constitution of the United States over-<lb/> shadows, there
                    is no single spot,â€” however narrow or<lb/> desolate,â€” where a
                    fugitive slave can plant himself<lb/> and say, "I am safe." The whole armory of
                    North-<lb/> ern Law has no shield for you. I am free to say that,<lb/> in your
                    place, I should throw the MS. into the fire.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>You, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, en-<lb/> deared as you are to so
                    many warm hearts by rare<lb/> gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to the
                    service<lb/> of others. But it will be owing only to your labors,<lb/> and the
                    fearless efforts of those who, trampling the<lb/> laws and Constitution of the
                    country under their<lb/> feet, are determined that they will "hide the out-<lb/>
                    cast," and that their hearths shall be, spite of the<lb/> law, an asylum for the
                    oppressed, if, some time or<lb/> other, the humblest may stand in our streets,
                    and<lb/> bear witness in safety against the cruelties of which<lb/> he has been
                    the victim.<lb/>
                    <pb n="xxiv"/>
                </p>
                <p>Yet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing<lb/> hearts which welcome your
                    story, and form your best<lb/> safeguard in telling it, are all beating contrary
                    to the<lb/> "statute in such case made and provided." Go on,<lb/> my dear
                    friend, till you, and those who, like you,<lb/> have been saved, so as by fire,
                    from the dark prison-<lb/> house, shall stereotype these free, illegal pulses
                    into<lb/> statutes; and New England, cutting loose from a<lb/> blood-stained
                    Union, shall glory in being the house<lb/> of refuge for the oppressed,â€”
                    till we no longer merely<lb/> "HIDE the outcast," or make a merit of standing
                    idly<lb/> by while he is hunted in our midst; but, consecrat-<lb/> ing anew the
                    soil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the<lb/> oppressed, proclaim our WELCOME
                    to the slave so<lb/> loudly, that the tones shall reach every hut in the<lb/>
                    Carolinas, and make the broken-hearted bondman<lb/> leap up at the thought of
                    old Massachusetts.<lb/> God speed the day!<lb/>
                    <lb/> TILL THEN, AND EVER,<lb/> YOURS TRULY,<lb/> WENDELL PHILLIPS<lb/></p>

                <p>FREDERICK DOUGLASS.<lb/>
                    <lb/> Frederick Douglass was born in slavery as Fred-<lb/> erick Augustus
                    Washington Bailey near Easton in<lb/> Talbot County, Maryland. He was not sure
                    of the<lb/> exact year of his birth, but he knew that it was 1817<lb/> or 1818.
                    As a young boy he was sent to Baltimore,<lb/> to be a house servant, where he
                    learned to read and<lb/> write, with the assistance of his master's wife.
                    In<lb/> 1838 he escaped from slavery and went to New York<lb/> City, where he
                    married Anna Murray, a free colored<lb/> woman whom he had met in Baltimore.
                    Soon there-<lb/> after he changed his name to Frederick Douglass.<lb/> In 1841
                    he addressed a convention of the Massa-<lb/> chusetts Anti-Slavery Society in
                    Nantucket and so<lb/> greatly impressed the group that they immediately<lb/>
                    employed him as an agent. He was such an impres-<lb/> sive orator that numerous
                    persons doubted if he had<lb/> ever been a slave, so he wrote NARRATIVE OF THE
                    LIFE<lb/> OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS. During the Civil War he as-<lb/> sisted in the
                    recruiting of colored men for the 54th<lb/> and 55th Massachusetts Regiments and
                    consistently<lb/> argued for the emancipation of slaves. After the war<lb/> he
                    was active in securing and protecting the rights<lb/> of the freemen. In his
                    later years, at different times,<lb/> he was secretary of the Santo Domingo
                    Commission,<lb/> marshall and recorder of deeds of the District of<lb/>
                    Columbia, and United States Minister to Haiti. His<lb/> other autobiographical
                    works are MY BONDAGE AND<lb/> MY FREEDOM and LIFE AND TIMES OF FREDERICK<lb/>
                    DOUGLASS, published in 1855 and 1881 respectively.<lb/> He died in 1895.</p>

                <head>I</head>
                <p>I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and<lb/> about twelve miles from
                    Easton, in Talbot county,<lb/> Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my
                    age,<lb/> never having seen any authentic record containing it.<lb/> By far the
                    larger part of the slaves know as little of<lb/> their ages as horses know of
                    theirs, and it is the wish<lb/> of most masters within my knowledge to keep
                    their<lb/> slaves thus ignorant. I do not remember to have ever<lb/> met a slave
                    who could tell of his birthday. They<lb/> seldom come nearer to it than
                    planting-time, harvest-<lb/> time, cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A
                    want<lb/> of information concerning my own was a source of<lb/> unhappiness to
                    me even during childhood. The white<lb/> children could tell their ages. I could
                    not tell why I<lb/> ought to be deprived of the same privilege. I was<lb/> not
                    allowed to make any inquiries of my master con-<lb/> cerning it. He deemed all
                    such inquiries on the part<lb/> of a slave improper and impertinent, and
                    evidence<lb/> of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give<lb/> makes
                    me now between twenty-seven and twenty-<lb/> eight years of age. I come to this,
                    from hearing my<lb/> master say, some time during 1835, I was about<lb/>
                    seventeen years old.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was<lb/> the daughter of Isaac and Betsey
                    Bailey, both col-<lb/> ored, and quite dark. My mother was of a darker<lb/>
                    complexion than either my grandmother or grand-<lb/> father.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>My father was a white man. He was admitted to<lb/> be such by all I ever heard
                    speak of my parentage.<lb/>
                    <pb n="2"/> The opinion was also whispered that my master was<lb/> my father;
                    but of the correctness of this opinion, I<lb/> know nothing; the means of
                    knowing was withheld<lb/> from me. My mother and I were separated when I<lb/>
                    was but an infantâ€” before I knew her as my mother.<lb/> It is a common
                    custom, in the part of Maryland<lb/> from which I ran away, to part children
                    from their<lb/> mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the<lb/> child
                    has reached its twelfth month, its mother is<lb/> taken from it, and hired out
                    on some farm a con-<lb/> siderable distance off, and the child is placed
                    under<lb/> the care of an old woman, too old for field labor.<lb/> For what this
                    separation is done, I do not know,<lb/> unless it be to hinder the development
                    of the child's<lb/> affection toward its mother, and to blunt and destroy<lb/>
                    the natural affection of the mother for the child.<lb/> This is the inevitable
                    result.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more<lb/> than four or five times in
                    my life; and each of these<lb/> times was very short in duration, and at night.
                    She<lb/> was hired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve<lb/> miles from my
                    home. She made her journeys to see<lb/> me in the night, travelling the whole
                    distance on<lb/> foot, after the performance of her day's work. She<lb/> was a
                    field hand, and a whipping is the penalty of<lb/> not being in the field at
                    sunrise, unless a slave has<lb/> special permission from his or her master to
                    the con-<lb/> traryâ€” a permission which they seldom get, and one<lb/>
                    that gives to him that gives it the proud name of<lb/> being a kind master. I do
                    not recollect of ever seeing<lb/> my mother by the light of day. She was with me
                    in<lb/> the night. She would lie down with me, and get me<lb/> to sleep, but
                    long before I waked she was gone. Very<lb/> little communication ever took place
                    between us.<lb/> Death soon ended what little we could have while<lb/> she
                    lived, and with it her hardships and suffering.<lb/> She died when I was about
                    seven years old, on one<lb/>
                    <pb n="3"/> of my master's farms, near Lee's Mill. I was not al-<lb/> lowed to
                    be present during her illness, at her death,<lb/> or burial. She was gone long
                    before I knew any thing<lb/> about it. Never having enjoyed, to any
                    considerable<lb/> extent, her soothing presence, her tender and watch-<lb/> ful
                    care, I received the tidings of her death with<lb/> much the same emotions I
                    should have probably<lb/> felt at the death of a stranger.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Called thus suddenly away, she left me without<lb/> the slightest intimation of
                    who my father was. The<lb/> whisper that my master was my father, may or
                    may<lb/> not be true; and, true or false, it is of but little con-<lb/> sequence
                    to my purpose whilst the fact remains,<lb/> in all its glaring odiousness, that
                    slaveholders have<lb/> ordained, and by law established, that the children<lb/>
                    of slave women shall in all cases follow the condi-<lb/> tion of their mothers;
                    and this is done too obviously<lb/> to administer to their own lusts, and make a
                    grati-<lb/> fication of their wicked desires profitable as well as<lb/>
                    pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the<lb/> slaveholder, in cases not
                    a few, sustains to his slaves<lb/> the double relation of master and
                    father.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark<lb/> that such slaves invariably
                    suffer greater hardships,<lb/> and have more to contend with, than others.
                    They<lb/> are, in the first place, a constant offence to their<lb/> mistress.
                    She is ever disposed to find fault with them;<lb/> they can seldom do any thing
                    to please her; she is<lb/> never better pleased than when she sees them
                    under<lb/> the lash, especially when she suspects her husband<lb/> of showing to
                    his mulatto children favors which he<lb/> withholds from his black slaves. The
                    master is fre-<lb/> quently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out<lb/>
                    of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and,<lb/> cruel as the deed may
                    strike any one to be, for a<lb/> man to sell his own children to human
                    flesh-mongers,<lb/> it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so;<lb/>
                    <pb n="4"/> for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them<lb/> himself,
                    but must stand by and see one white son<lb/> tie up his brother, of but few
                    shades darker com-<lb/> plexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his<lb/>
                    naked back; and if he lisp one word of disapproval,<lb/> it is set down to his
                    parental partiality, and only<lb/> makes a bad matter worse, both for himself
                    and the<lb/> slave whom he would protect and defend.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Every year brings with it multitudes of this class<lb/> of slaves. It was
                    doubtless in consequence of a knowl-<lb/> edge of this fact, that one great
                    statesman of the<lb/> south predicted the downfall of slavery by the in-<lb/>
                    evitable laws of population. Whether this prophecy<lb/> is ever fulfilled or
                    not, it is nevertheless plain that a<lb/> very different-looking class of people
                    are springing up<lb/> at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those<lb/>
                    originally brought to this country from Africa; and<lb/> if their increase do no
                    other good, it will do<lb/> away the force of the argument, that God cursed<lb/>
                    Ham, and therefore American slavery is right. If the<lb/> lineal descendants of
                    Ham are alone to be scriptur-<lb/> ally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at
                    the south<lb/> must soon become unscriptural; for thousands are<lb/> ushered
                    into the world, annually, who, like myself,<lb/> owe their existence to white
                    fathers, and those fa-<lb/> thers most frequently their own masters.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have had two masters. My first master's name<lb/> was Anthony. I do not
                    remember his first name.<lb/> He was generally called Captain Anthonyâ€” a
                    title<lb/> which, I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on<lb/> the
                    Chesapeake Bay. He was not considered a rich<lb/> slaveholder. He owned two or
                    three farms, and about<lb/> thirty slaves. His farms and slaves were under
                    the<lb/> care of an overseer. The overseer's name was<lb/> Plummer. Mr. Plummer
                    was a miserable drunkard,<lb/> a profane swearer, and a savage monster. He
                    always<lb/> went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel. I<lb/>
                    <pb n="5"/> have known him to cut and slash the women's heads<lb/> so horribly,
                    that even master would be enraged at<lb/> his cruelty, and would threaten to
                    whip him if he<lb/> did not mind himself. Master, however, was not a<lb/> humane
                    slaveholder. It required extraordinary bar-<lb/> barity on the part of an
                    overseer to affect him. He<lb/> was a cruel man, hardened by a long life of
                    slave-<lb/> holding. He would at times seem to take great pleas-<lb/> ure in
                    whipping a slave. I have often been awakened<lb/> at the dawn of day by the most
                    heart-rending shrieks<lb/> of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tie up<lb/>
                    to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she<lb/> was literally covered
                    with blood. No words, no tears,<lb/> no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to
                    move<lb/> his iron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder<lb/> she screamed,
                    the harder he whipped; and where<lb/> the blood ran fastest, there he whipped
                    longest. He<lb/> would whip her to make her scream, and whip her<lb/> to make
                    her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue,<lb/> would he cease to swing the
                    blood-clotted cowskin.<lb/> I remember the first time I ever witnessed this
                    hor-<lb/> rible exhibition. I was quite a child, but I well re-<lb/> member it.
                    I never shall forget it whilst I remember<lb/> any thing. It was the first of a
                    long series of such out-<lb/> rages, of which I was doomed to be a witness and
                    a<lb/> participant. It struck me with awful force. It was<lb/> the blood-stained
                    gate, the entrance to the hell of<lb/> slavery, through which I was about to
                    pass. It was<lb/> a most terrible spectacle. I wish I could commit to<lb/> paper
                    the feelings with which I beheld it.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>This occurrence took place very soon after I went<lb/> to live with my old
                    master, and under the following<lb/> circumstances. Aunt Hester went out one
                    night,â€”<lb/> where or for what I do not know,â€” and happened
                    to<lb/> be absent when my master desired her presence. He<lb/> had ordered her
                    not to go out evenings, and warned<lb/> her that she must never let him catch
                    her in com-<lb/>
                    <pb n="6"/> pany with a young man, who was paying attention<lb/> to her
                    belonging to Colonel Lloyd. The young man's<lb/> name was Ned Roberts, generally
                    called Lloyd's<lb/> Ned. Why master was so careful of her, may be<lb/> safely
                    left to conjecture. She was a woman of noble<lb/> form, and of graceful
                    proportions, having very few<lb/> equals, and fewer superiors, in personal
                    appearance,<lb/> among the colored or white women of our neighbor-<lb/>
                    hood.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in<lb/> going out, but had been
                    found in company with<lb/> Lloyd's Ned; which circumstance, I found, from<lb/>
                    what he said while whipping her, was the chief of-<lb/> fence. Had he been a man
                    of pure morals himself,<lb/> he might have been thought interested in
                    protecting<lb/> the innocence of my aunt; but those who knew him<lb/> will not
                    suspect him of any such virtue. Before<lb/> he commenced whipping Aunt Hester,
                    he took her<lb/> into the kitchen, and stripped her from neck to waist,<lb/>
                    leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely<lb/> naked. He then told her to
                    cross her hands, calling<lb/> her at the same time a dâ€” -d bâ€” -h.
                    After crossing<lb/> her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led<lb/> her
                    to a stool under a large hook in the joist, put<lb/> in for the purpose. He made
                    her get upon the stool,<lb/> and tied her hands to the hook. She now stood
                    fair<lb/> for his infernal purpose. Her arms were stretched<lb/> up at their
                    full length, so that she stood upon the<lb/> ends of her toes. He then said to
                    her, "Now, you<lb/> dâ€” -d bâ€” -h, I'll learn you how to disobey
                    my<lb/> orders!" and after rolling up his sleeves, he com-<lb/> menced to lay on
                    the heavy cowskin, and soon the<lb/> warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieks
                    from<lb/> her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to<lb/> the floor. I was
                    so terrified and horror-stricken at the<lb/> sight, that I hid myself in a
                    closet, and dared not<lb/> venture out till long after the bloody transaction was<lb/>
                    <pb n="7"/> over. I expected it would be my turn next. It was<lb/> all new to
                    me. I had never seen any thing like it<lb/> before. I had always lived with my
                    grandmother on<lb/> the outskirts of the plantation, where she was put to<lb/>
                    raise the children of the younger women. I had there-<lb/> fore been, until now,
                    out of the way of the bloody<lb/> scenes that often occurred on the plantation.<lb/>

                <lb/>
                <p>My master's family consisted of two sons, Andrew<lb/> and Richard; one daughter,
                    Lucretia, and her hus-<lb/> band, Captain Thomas Auld. They lived in one<lb/>
                    house, upon the home plantation of Colonel Edward<lb/> Lloyd. My master was
                    Colonel Lloyd's clerk and<lb/> superintendent. He was what might be called
                    the<lb/> overseer of the overseers. I spent two years of child-<lb/> hood on
                    this plantation in my old master's family.<lb/> It was here that I witnessed the
                    bloody transaction<lb/> recorded in the first chapter; and as I received my<lb/>
                    first impressions of slavery on this plantation,<lb/> I will give some
                    description of it, and of slavery as<lb/> it there existed. The plantation is
                    about twelve miles<lb/> north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated<lb/>
                    on the border of Miles River. The principal products<lb/> raised upon it were
                    tobacco, corn, and wheat. These<lb/> were raised in great abundance; so that,
                    with the<lb/> products of this and the other farms belonging to<lb/> him, he was
                    able to keep in almost constant em-<lb/> ployment a large sloop, in carrying
                    them to market<lb/> at Baltimore. This sloop was named Sally Lloyd,<lb/> in
                    honor of one of the colonel's daughters. My mas-<lb/> ter's son-in-law, Captain
                    Auld, was master of the<lb/> vessel; she was otherwise manned by the
                    colonel's<lb/> own slaves. Their names were Peter, Isaac, Rich, and<lb/> Jake.
                    These were esteemed very highly by the other<lb/> slaves, and looked upon as the
                    privileged ones of the<lb/> plantation; for it was no small affair, in the eyes
                    of<lb/> the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred<lb/>
                    <pb n="10"/> slaves on his home plantation, and owned a large<lb/> number more
                    on the neighboring farms belonging to<lb/> him. The names of the farms nearest
                    to the home<lb/> plantation were Wye Town and New Design. "Wye<lb/> Town" was
                    under the overseership of a man named<lb/> Noah Willis. New Design was under the
                    overseer-<lb/> ship of a Mr. Townsend. The overseers of these,<lb/> and all the
                    rest of the farms, numbering over twenty,<lb/> received advice and direction
                    from the managers of<lb/> the home plantation. This was the great business<lb/>
                    place. It was the seat of government for the whole<lb/> twenty farms. All
                    disputes among the overseers were<lb/> settled here. If a slave was convicted of
                    any high<lb/> misdemeanor, became unmanageable, or evinced a<lb/> determination
                    to run away, he was brought immedi-<lb/> ately here, severely whipped, put on
                    board the sloop,<lb/> carried to Baltimore, and sold to Austin Woolfolk,<lb/> or
                    some other slave-trader, as a warning to the slaves<lb/> remaining.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Here, too, the slaves of all the other farms received<lb/> their monthly
                    allowance of food, and their yearly<lb/> clothing. The men and women slaves
                    received, as<lb/> their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of<lb/> pork, or
                    its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of<lb/> corn meal. Their yearly clothing
                    consisted of two<lb/> coarse linen shirts, one pair of linen trousers, like<lb/>
                    the shirts, one jacket, one pair of trousers for winter,<lb/> made of coarse
                    negro cloth, one pair of stockings,<lb/> and one pair of shoes; the whole of
                    which could not<lb/> have cost more than seven dollars. The allowance<lb/> of
                    the slave children was given to their mothers, or<lb/> the old women having the
                    care of them. The chil-<lb/> dren unable to work in the field had neither
                    shoes,<lb/> stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them; their<lb/> clothing
                    consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year.<lb/> When these failed them, they
                    went naked until the<lb/> next allowance-day. Children from seven to ten years<lb/>
                    <pb n="11"/> old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen<lb/> at all seasons
                    of the year.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>There were no beds given the slaves, unless one<lb/> coarse blanket be considered
                    such, and none but<lb/> the men and women had these. This, however, is<lb/> not
                    considered a very great privation. They find less<lb/> difficulty from the want
                    of beds, than from the want<lb/> of time to sleep; for when their day's work in
                    the<lb/> field is done, the most of them having their wash-<lb/> ing, mending,
                    and cooking to do, and having few or<lb/> none of the ordinary facilities for
                    doing either of<lb/> these, very many of their sleeping hours are con-<lb/>
                    sumed in preparing for the field the coming day;<lb/> and when this is done, old
                    and young, male and<lb/> female, married and single, drop down side by
                    side,<lb/> on one common bed,â€” the cold, damp floor,â€” each<lb/>
                    covering himself or herself with their miserable<lb/> blankets; and here they
                    sleep till they are summoned<lb/> to the field by the driver's horn. At the
                    sound of<lb/> this, all must rise, and be off to the field. There<lb/> must be
                    no halting; every one must be at his or<lb/> her post; and woe betides them who
                    hear not this<lb/> morning summons to the field; for if they are not<lb/>
                    awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the<lb/> sense of feeling: no age
                    nor sex finds any favor.<lb/> Mr. Severe, the overseer, used to stand by the
                    door<lb/> of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick<lb/> and heavy
                    cowskin, ready to whip any one who was<lb/> so unfortunate as not to hear, or,
                    from any other<lb/> cause, was prevented from being ready to start for<lb/> the
                    field at the sound of the horn.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Severe was rightly named: he was a cruel<lb/> man. I have seen him whip a
                    woman, causing the<lb/> blood to run half an hour at the time; and this,
                    too,<lb/> in the midst of her crying children, pleading for their<lb/> mother's
                    release. He seemed to take pleasure in<lb/> manifesting his fiendish barbarity.
                    Added to his<lb/>
                    <pb n="12"/> cruelty, he was a profane swearer. It was enough to<lb/> chill the
                    blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary<lb/> man to hear him talk. Scarce a
                    sentence escaped him<lb/> but that was commenced or concluded by some hor-<lb/>
                    rid oath. The field was the place to witness his<lb/> cruelty and profanity. His
                    presence made it both<lb/> the field of blood and of blasphemy. From the
                    rising<lb/> till the going down of the sun, he was cursing, raving,<lb/>
                    cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field,<lb/> in the most frightful
                    manner. His career was short.<lb/> He died very soon after I went to Colonel
                    Lloyd's;<lb/> and he died as he lived, uttering, with his dying<lb/> groans,
                    bitter curses and horrid oaths. His death was<lb/> regarded by the slaves as the
                    result of a merciful<lb/> providence.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Severe's place was filled by a Mr. Hopkins.<lb/> He was a very different man.
                    He was less cruel, less<lb/> profane, and made less noise, than Mr. Severe.
                    His<lb/> course was characterized by no extraordinary demon-<lb/> strations of
                    cruelty. He whipped, but seemed to take<lb/> no pleasure in it. He was called by
                    the slaves a good<lb/> overseer.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the<lb/> appearance of a country
                    village. All the mechanical<lb/> operations for all the farms were performed
                    here.<lb/> The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing,<lb/> cartwrighting,
                    coopering, weaving, and grain-grind-<lb/> ing, were all performed by the slaves
                    on the home<lb/> plantation. The whole place wore a business-like as-<lb/> pect
                    very unlike the neighboring farms. The num-<lb/> ber of houses, too, conspired
                    to give it advantage<lb/> over the neighboring farms. It was called by the<lb/>
                    slaves the GREAT HOUSE FARM. Few privileges were<lb/> esteemed higher, by the
                    slaves of the out-farms, than<lb/> that of being selected to do errands at the
                    Great<lb/> House Farm. It was associated in their minds with<lb/> greatness. A
                    representative could not be prouder of<lb/>
                    <pb n="13"/> his election to a seat in the American Congress,<lb/> than a slave
                    on one of the out-farms would be of his<lb/> election to do errands at the Great
                    House Farm.<lb/> They regarded it as evidence of great confidence re-<lb/> posed
                    in them by their overseers; and it was on<lb/> this account, as well as a
                    constant desire to be out of<lb/> the field from under the driver's lash, that
                    they es-<lb/> teemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living<lb/> for. He
                    was called the smartest and most trusty fel-<lb/> low, who had this honor
                    conferred upon him the<lb/> most frequently. The competitors for this
                    office<lb/> sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the<lb/>
                    office-seekers in the political parties seek to please<lb/> and deceive the
                    people. The same traits of character<lb/> might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's
                    slaves, as are seen<lb/> in the slaves of the political parties.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm,<lb/> for the monthly allowance
                    for themselves and their<lb/> fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic. While
                    on<lb/> their way, they would make the dense old woods,<lb/> for miles around,
                    reverberate with their wild songs,<lb/> revealing at once the highest joy and
                    the deepest<lb/> sadness. They would compose and sing as they went<lb/> along,
                    consulting neither time nor tune. The thought<lb/> that came up, came out
                   â€” if not in the word, in the<lb/> sound;â€” and as frequently in the
                    one as in the other.<lb/> They would sometimes sing the most pathetic
                    senti-<lb/> ment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rap-<lb/> turous
                    sentiment in the most pathetic tone. Into all<lb/> of their songs they would
                    manage to weave some-<lb/> thing of the Great House Farm. Especially would<lb/>
                    they do this, when leaving home. They would then<lb/> sing most exultingly the
                    following words:â€”<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p> "I am going away to the Great House Farm!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> O, yea! O, yea! O!"<lb/>
                    <pb n="14"/> This they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to<lb/> many
                    would seem unmeaning jargon, but which,<lb/> nevertheless, were full of meaning
                    to themselves. I<lb/> have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of<lb/> those
                    songs would do more to impress some minds<lb/> with the horrible character of
                    slavery, than the read-<lb/> ing of whole volumes of philosophy on the
                    subject<lb/> could do.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I did not, when a slave, understand the deep<lb/> meaning of those rude and
                    apparently incoherent<lb/> songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I
                    nei-<lb/> ther saw nor heard as those without might see and<lb/> hear. They told
                    a tale of woe which was then al-<lb/> together beyond my feeble comprehension;
                    they<lb/> were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the<lb/> prayer and
                    complaint of souls boiling over with the<lb/> bitterest anguish. Every tone was
                    a testimony against<lb/> slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from<lb/>
                    chains. The hearing of those wild notes always de-<lb/> pressed my spirit, and
                    filled me with ineffable sad-<lb/> ness. I have frequently found myself in tears
                    while<lb/> hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs,<lb/> even now,
                    afflicts me; and while I am writing these<lb/> lines, an expression of feeling
                    has already found its<lb/> way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my
                    first<lb/> glimmering conception of the dehumanizing char-<lb/> acter of
                    slavery. I can never get rid of that concep-<lb/> tion. Those songs still follow
                    me, to deepen my<lb/> hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for<lb/> my
                    brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be im-<lb/> pressed with the
                    soul-killing effects of slavery, let<lb/> him go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation,
                    and, on allow-<lb/> ance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and<lb/>
                    there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that<lb/> shall pass through the
                    chambers of his soul,â€” and if<lb/> he is not thus impressed, it will only
                    be because<lb/> "there is no flesh in his obdurate heart."<lb/>
                    <pb n="15"/>
                </p>
                <p>I have often been utterly astonished, since I came<lb/> to the north, to find
                    persons who could speak of<lb/> the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their
                    con-<lb/> tentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive<lb/> of a greater
                    mistake. Slaves sing most when they are<lb/> most unhappy. The songs of the
                    slave represent the<lb/> sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by them,
                    only<lb/> as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least,<lb/> such is my
                    experience. I have often sung to drown<lb/> my sorrow, but seldom to express my
                    happiness.<lb/> Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike un-<lb/> common
                    to me while in the jaws of slavery. The<lb/> singing of a man cast away upon a
                    desolate island<lb/> might be as appropriately considered as evidence of<lb/>
                    contentment and happiness, as the singing of a<lb/> slave; the songs of the one
                    and of the other are<lb/> prompted by the same emotion.<lb/>

                <p>Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated<lb/> garden, which afforded
                    almost constant employment<lb/> for four men, besides the chief gardener,
                    (Mr.<lb/> M'Durmond.) This garden was probably the great-<lb/> est attraction of
                    the place. During the summer<lb/> months, people came from far and nearâ€”
                    from<lb/> Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolisâ€” to see it. It<lb/> abounded
                    in fruits of almost every description, from<lb/> the hardy apple of the north to
                    the delicate orange<lb/> of the south. This garden was not the least source<lb/>
                    of trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was<lb/> quite a temptation to
                    the hungry swarms of boys,<lb/> as well as the older slaves, belonging to the
                    colonel,<lb/> few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist<lb/> it. Scarcely
                    a day passed, during the summer, but<lb/> that some slave had to take the lash
                    for stealing fruit.<lb/> The colonel had to resort to all kinds of
                    stratagems<lb/> to keep his slaves out of the garden. The last and<lb/> most
                    successful one was that of tarring his fence<lb/> all around; after which, if a
                    slave was caught with<lb/> any tar upon his person, it was deemed
                    sufficient<lb/> proof that he had either been into the garden, or had<lb/> tried
                    to get in. In either case, he was severely whip-<lb/> ped by the chief gardener.
                    This plan worked well;<lb/> the slaves became as fearful of tar as of the
                    lash.<lb/> They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching<lb/> TAR without
                    being defiled.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage.<lb/> His stable and
                    carriage-house presented the appear-<lb/> ance of some of our large city livery establishments.<lb/>
                    <pb n="18"/> His horses were of the finest form and noblest blood.<lb/> His
                    carriage-house contained three splendid coaches,<lb/> three or four gigs,
                    besides dearborns and barouches<lb/> of the most fashionable style.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>This establishment was under the care of two<lb/> slavesâ€” old Barney and
                    young Barneyâ€” father and son.<lb/> To attend to this establishment was
                    their sole work.<lb/> But it was by no means an easy employment; for in<lb/>
                    nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in<lb/> the management of his
                    horses. The slightest inat-<lb/> tention to these was unpardonable, and was
                    visited<lb/> upon those, under whose care they were placed, with<lb/> the
                    severest punishment; no excuse could shield<lb/> them, if the colonel only
                    suspected any want of<lb/> attention to his horsesâ€” a supposition which
                    he fre-<lb/> quently indulged, and one which, of course, made<lb/> the office of
                    old and young Barney a very trying one.<lb/> They never knew when they were safe
                    from punish-<lb/> ment. They were frequently whipped when least<lb/> deserving,
                    and escaped whipping when most deserv-<lb/> ing it. Every thing depended upon
                    the looks of the<lb/> horses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd's own mind<lb/>
                    when his horses were brought to him for use. If a<lb/> horse did not move fast
                    enough, or hold his head<lb/> high enough, it was owing to some fault of his
                    keep-<lb/> ers. It was painful to stand near the stable-door,<lb/> and hear the
                    various complaints against the keepers<lb/> when a horse was taken out for use.
                    "This horse has<lb/> not had proper attention. He has not been suffi-<lb/>
                    ciently rubbed and curried, or he has not been prop-<lb/> erly fed; his food was
                    too wet or too dry; he got it<lb/> too soon or too late; he was too hot or too
                    cold; he<lb/> had too much hay, and not enough of grain; or he<lb/> had too much
                    grain, and not enough of hay; instead<lb/> of old Barney's attending to the
                    horse, he had very<lb/> improperly left it to his son." To all these com-<lb/>
                    plaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must an-<lb/>
                    <pb n="19"/> swer never a word. Colonel Lloyd could not brook<lb/> any
                    contradiction from a slave. When he spoke, a<lb/> slave must stand, listen, and
                    tremble; and such was<lb/> literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd
                    make<lb/> old Barney, a man between fifty and sixty years of<lb/> age, uncover
                    his bald head, kneel down upon the<lb/> cold, damp ground, and receive upon his
                    naked and<lb/> toil-worn shoulders more than thirty lashes at the<lb/> time.
                    Colonel Lloyd had three sonsâ€” Edward, Mur-<lb/> ray, and Daniel,â€”
                    and three sons-in-law, Mr. Winder,<lb/> Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of
                    these lived<lb/> at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of<lb/>
                    whipping the servants when they pleased, from old<lb/> Barney down to William
                    Wilkes, the coach-driver.<lb/> I have seen Winder make one of the
                    house-servants<lb/> stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched<lb/>
                    with the end of his whip, and at every stroke raise<lb/> great ridges upon his
                    back.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would<lb/> be almost equal to describing
                    the riches of Job. He<lb/> kept from ten to fifteen house-servants. He was
                    said<lb/> to own a thousand slaves, and I think this estimate<lb/> quite within
                    the truth. Colonel Lloyd owned so<lb/> many that he did not know them when he
                    saw them;<lb/> nor did all the slaves of the out-farms know him. It<lb/> is
                    reported of him, that, while riding along the road<lb/> one day, he met a
                    colored man, and addressed him<lb/> in the usual manner of speaking to colored
                    people<lb/> on the public highways of the south: "Well, boy,<lb/> whom do you
                    belong to?" "To Colonel Lloyd," re-<lb/> plied the slave. "Well, does the
                    colonel treat you<lb/> well?" "No, sir," was the ready reply. "What, does<lb/>
                    he work you too hard?" "Yes, sir." "Well, don't he<lb/> give you enough to eat?"
                    "Yes, sir, he gives me<lb/> enough, such as it is."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The colonel, after ascertaining where the slave<lb/> belonged, rode on; the man
                    also went on about his<lb/>
                    <pb n="20"/> business, not dreaming that he had been conversing<lb/> with his
                    master. He thought, said, and heard noth-<lb/> ing more of the matter, until two
                    or three weeks<lb/> afterwards. The poor man was then informed by his<lb/>
                    overseer that, for having found fault with his master,<lb/> he was now to be
                    sold to a Georgia trader. He was<lb/> immediately chained and handcuffed; and
                    thus,<lb/> without a moment's warning, he was snatched away,<lb/> and forever
                    sundered, from his family and friends,<lb/> by a hand more unrelenting than
                    death. This is the<lb/> penalty of telling the truth, of telling the simple<lb/>
                    truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>It is partly in consequence of such facts, that<lb/> slaves, when inquired of as
                    to their condition and<lb/> the character of their masters, almost universally
                    say<lb/> they are contented, and that their masters are kind.<lb/> The
                    slaveholders have been known to send in spies<lb/> among their slaves, to
                    ascertain their views and feel-<lb/> ings in regard to their condition. The
                    frequency of<lb/> this has had the effect to establish among the slaves<lb/> the
                    maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head.<lb/> They suppress the truth
                    rather than take the con-<lb/> sequences of telling it, and in so doing prove
                    them-<lb/> selves a part of the human family. If they have any<lb/> thing to say
                    of their masters, it is generally in their<lb/> masters' favor, especially when
                    speaking to an un-<lb/> tried man. I have been frequently asked, when a<lb/>
                    slave, if I had a kind master, and do not remember<lb/> ever to have given a
                    negative answer; nor did I, in<lb/> pursuing this course, consider myself as
                    uttering what<lb/> was absolutely false; for I always measured the kind-<lb/>
                    ness of my master by the standard of kindness set<lb/> up among slaveholders
                    around us. Moreover, slaves<lb/> are like other people, and imbibe prejudices
                    quite<lb/> common to others. They think their own better than<lb/> that of
                    others. Many, under the influence of this<lb/> prejudice, think their own
                    masters are better than<lb/>
                    <pb n="21"/> the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some<lb/> cases,
                    when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is<lb/> not uncommon for slaves even
                    to fall out and quar-<lb/> rel among themselves about the relative goodness
                    of<lb/> their masters, each contending for the superior good-<lb/> ness of his
                    own over that of the others. At the very<lb/> same time, they mutually execrate
                    their masters<lb/> when viewed separately. It was so on our plantation.<lb/>
                    When Colonel Lloyd's slaves met the slaves of Jacob<lb/> Jepson, they seldom
                    parted without a quarrel about<lb/> their masters; Colonel Lloyd's slaves
                    contending that<lb/> he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson's slaves that he<lb/>
                    was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel Lloyd's<lb/> slaves would boast his
                    ability to buy and sell Jacob<lb/> Jepson. Mr. Jepson's slaves would boast his
                    ability<lb/> to whip Colonel Lloyd. These quarrels would almost<lb/> always end
                    in a fight between the parties, and those<lb/> that whipped were supposed to
                    have gained the<lb/> point at issue. They seemed to think that the great-<lb/>
                    ness of their masters was transferable to themselves.<lb/> It was considered as
                    being bad enough to be a<lb/> slave; but to be a poor man's slave was deemed
                    a<lb/> disgrace indeed!<lb/>

                <p>Mr. Hopkins remained but a short time in the<lb/> office of overseer. Why his

                    necessary<lb/> severity to suit Colonel Lloyd. Mr. Hopkins was suc-<lb/> ceeded
                    by Mr. Austin Gore, a man possessing, in<lb/> an eminent degree, all those
                    traits of character in-<lb/> dispensable to what is called a first-rate
                    overseer. Mr.<lb/> Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in the capacity of<lb/>
                    overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown<lb/> himself worthy of the
                    high station of overseer upon<lb/> the home or Great House Farm.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering.<lb/> He was artful, cruel, and
                    obdurate. He was just the<lb/> man for such a place, and it was just the place
                    for<lb/> such a man. It afforded scope for the full exercise<lb/> of all his
                    powers, and he seemed to be perfectly<lb/> at home in it. He was one of those
                    who could torture<lb/> the slightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of<lb/>
                    the slave, into impudence, and would treat it ac-<lb/> cordingly. There must be
                    no answering back to him;<lb/> no explanation was allowed a slave, showing
                    himself<lb/> to have been wrongfully accused. Mr. Gore acted<lb/> fully up to
                    the maxim laid down by slaveholders,â€”<lb/> "It is better that a dozen
                    slaves should suffer under the<lb/> lash, than that the overseer should be
                    convicted, in<lb/> the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault."<lb/> No
                    matter how innocent a slave might beâ€” it availed<lb/> him nothing, when
                    accused by Mr. Gore of any<lb/> misdemeanor. To be accused was to be
                    convicted,<lb/> and to be convicted was to be punished; the one<lb/>
                    <pb n="24"/> always following the other with immutable certainty.<lb/> To escape
                    punishment was to escape accusation; and<lb/> few slaves had the fortune to do
                    either, under the<lb/> overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough<lb/>
                    to demand the most debasing homage of the slave,<lb/> and quite servile enough
                    to crouch, himself, at the<lb/> feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to
                    be<lb/> contented with nothing short of the highest rank<lb/> of overseers, and
                    persevering enough to reach the<lb/> height of his ambition. He was cruel enough
                    to in-<lb/> flict the severest punishment, artful enough to de-<lb/> scend to
                    the lowest trickery, and obdurate enough to<lb/> be insensible to the voice of a
                    reproving conscience.<lb/> He was, of all the overseers, the most dreaded
                    by<lb/> the slaves. His presence was painful; his eye flashed<lb/> confusion;
                    and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice<lb/> heard, without producing horror and
                    trembling in<lb/> their ranks.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young<lb/> man, he indulged in no jokes,
                    said no funny words,<lb/> seldom smiled. His words were in perfect keeping<lb/>
                    with his looks, and his looks were in perfect keeping<lb/> with his words.
                    Overseers will sometimes indulge in<lb/> a witty word, even with the slaves; not
                    so with Mr.<lb/> Gore. He spoke but to command, and commanded<lb/> but to be
                    obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words,<lb/> and bountifully with his whip,
                    never using the<lb/> former where the latter would answer as well. When<lb/> he
                    whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of<lb/> duty, and feared no
                    consequences. He did nothing<lb/> reluctantly, no matter how disagreeable;
                    always at his<lb/> post, never inconsistent. He never promised but to<lb/>
                    fulfil. He was, in a word, a man of the most in-<lb/> flexible firmness and
                    stone-like coolness.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>His savage barbarity was equalled only by the con-<lb/> summate coolness with
                    which he committed the<lb/> grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under<lb/>
                    <pb n="25"/> his charge. Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of<lb/> Colonel
                    Lloyd's slaves, by the name of Demby. He<lb/> had given Demby but few stripes,
                    when, to get rid<lb/> of the scourging, he ran and plunged himself into a<lb/>
                    creek, and stood there at the depth of his shoulders,<lb/> refusing to come out.
                    Mr. Gore told him that he<lb/> would give him three calls, and that, if he did
                    not<lb/> come out at the third call, he would shoot him.<lb/> The first call was
                    given. Demby made no response,<lb/> but stood his ground. The second and third
                    calls<lb/> were given with the same result. Mr. Gore then,<lb/> without
                    consultation or deliberation with any one,<lb/> not even giving Demby an
                    additional call, raised<lb/> his musket to his face, taking deadly aim at
                    his<lb/> standing victim, and in an instant poor Demby was<lb/> no more. His
                    mangled body sank out of sight, and<lb/> blood and brains marked the water where
                    he had<lb/> stood.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon<lb/> the plantation, excepting
                    Mr. Gore. He alone<lb/> seemed cool and collected. He was asked by Colonel<lb/>
                    Lloyd and my old master, why he resorted to this<lb/> extraordinary expedient.
                    His reply was, (as well as<lb/> I can remember,) that Demby had become
                    unman-<lb/> ageable. He was setting a dangerous example to the<lb/> other
                    slaves,â€” one which, if suffered to pass without<lb/> some such
                    demonstration on his part, would finally<lb/> lead to the total subversion of
                    all rule and order<lb/> upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave
                    re-<lb/> fused to be corrected, and escaped with his life, the<lb/> other slaves
                    would soon copy the example; the re-<lb/> sult of which would be, the freedom of
                    the slaves,<lb/> and the enslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore's de-<lb/> fence
                    was satisfactory. He was continued in his sta-<lb/> tion as overseer upon the
                    home plantation. His<lb/> fame as an overseer went abroad. His horrid crime<lb/>
                    was not even submitted to judicial investigation. It<lb/>
                    <pb n="26"/> was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of<lb/> course
                    could neither institute a suit, nor testify<lb/> against him; and thus the
                    guilty perpetrator of one of<lb/> the bloodiest and most foul murders goes
                    unwhipped<lb/> of justice, and uncensured by the community in<lb/> which he
                    lives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael's, Tal-<lb/> bot county, Maryland, when I
                    left there; and if he<lb/> is still alive, he very probably lives there now; and
                    if<lb/> so, he is now, as he was then, as highly esteemed<lb/> and as much
                    respected as though his guilty soul<lb/> had not been stained with his brother's
                    blood.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I speak advisedly when I say this,â€” that killing<lb/> a slave, or any
                    colored person, in Talbot county,<lb/> Maryland, is not treated as a crime,
                    either by the<lb/> courts or the community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, of<lb/> St.
                    Michael's, killed two slaves, one of whom he<lb/> killed with a hatchet, by
                    knocking his brains out. He<lb/> used to boast of the commission of the awful
                    and<lb/> bloody deed. I have heard him do so laughingly,<lb/> saying, among
                    other things, that he was the only<lb/> benefactor of his country in the
                    company, and that<lb/> when others would do as much as he had done, we<lb/>
                    should be relieved of "the dâ€” -d niggers."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, living but a short<lb/> distance from where I used
                    to live, murdered my<lb/> wife's cousin, a young girl between fifteen and
                    six-<lb/> teen years of age, mangling her person in the most<lb/> horrible
                    manner, breaking her nose and breastbone<lb/> with a stick, so that the poor
                    girl expired in a few<lb/> hours afterward. She was immediately buried, but<lb/>
                    had not been in her untimely grave but a few hours<lb/> before she was taken up
                    and examined by the cor-<lb/> oner, who decided that she had come to her
                    death<lb/> by severe beating. The offence for which this girl<lb/> was thus
                    murdered was this:â€” She had been set<lb/> that night to mind Mrs. Hicks's
                    baby, and during the<lb/> night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She, having<lb/>
                    <pb n="27"/> lost her rest for several nights previous, did not hear<lb/> the
                    crying. They were both in the room with Mrs.<lb/> Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding the
                    girl slow to move,<lb/> jumped from her bed, seized an oak stick of wood<lb/> by
                    the fireplace, and with it broke the girl's nose<lb/> and breastbone, and thus
                    ended her life. I will not<lb/> say that this most horrid murder produced no
                    sen-<lb/> sation in the community. It did produce sensation,<lb/> but not enough
                    to bring the murderess to punish-<lb/> ment. There was a warrant issued for her
                    arrest,<lb/> but it was never served. Thus she escaped not only<lb/> punishment,
                    but even the pain of being arraigned<lb/> before a court for her horrid
                    crime.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Whilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took<lb/> place during my stay on
                    Colonel Lloyd's plantation,<lb/> I will briefly narrate another, which occurred
                    about<lb/> the same time as the murder of Demby by Mr.<lb/> Gore.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Colonel Lloyd's slaves were in the habit of spend-<lb/> ing a part of their
                    nights and Sundays in fishing for<lb/> oysters, and in this way made up the
                    deficiency of<lb/> their scanty allowance. An old man belonging to<lb/> Colonel
                    Lloyd, while thus engaged, happened to get<lb/> beyond the limits of Colonel
                    Lloyd's, and on the<lb/> premises of Mr. Beal Bondly. At this trespass, Mr.<lb/>
                    Bondly took offence, and with his musket came<lb/> down to the shore, and blew
                    its deadly contents<lb/> into the poor old man.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the<lb/> next day, whether to pay him
                    for his property, or<lb/> to justify himself in what he had done, I know
                    not.<lb/> At any rate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon<lb/> hushed up.
                    There was very little said about it at all,<lb/> and nothing done. It was a
                    common saying, even<lb/> among little white boys, that it was worth a half-<lb/>
                    cent to kill a "nigger," and a half-cent to bury one.<lb/>

                <p>As to my own treatment while I lived on Colonel<lb/> Lloyd's plantation, it was
                    very similar to that of the<lb/> other slave children. I was not old enough to
                    work in<lb/> the field, and there being little else than field work<lb/> to do,
                    I had a great deal of leisure time. The most<lb/> I had to do was to drive up
                    the cows at evening,<lb/> keep the fowls out of the garden, keep the front<lb/>
                    yard clean, and run of errands for my old master's<lb/> daughter, Mrs. Lucretia
                    Auld. The most of my lei-<lb/> sure time I spent in helping Master Daniel
                    Lloyd<lb/> in finding his birds, after he had shot them. My<lb/> connection with
                    Master Daniel was of some advan-<lb/> tage to me. He became quite attached to
                    me, and<lb/> was a sort of protector of me. He would not allow<lb/> the older
                    boys to impose upon me, and would divide<lb/> his cakes with me.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was seldom whipped by my old master, and suf-<lb/> fered little from any thing
                    else than hunger and<lb/> cold. I suffered much from hunger, but much more<lb/>
                    from cold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I<lb/> was kept almost naked
                   â€” no shoes, no stockings, no<lb/> jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a
                    coarse tow linen<lb/> shirt, reaching only to my knees. I had no bed. I<lb/>
                    must have perished with cold, but that, the coldest<lb/> nights, I used to steal
                    a bag which was used for carry-<lb/> ing corn to the mill. I would crawl into
                    this bag,<lb/> and there sleep on the cold, damp, clay floor, with<lb/> my head
                    in and feet out. My feet have been so<lb/> cracked with the frost, that the pen
                    with which I<lb/> am writing might be laid in the gashes.<lb/>
                    <pb n="30"/>
                </p>
                <p>We were not regularly allowanced. Our food was<lb/> coarse corn meal boiled. This
                    was called MUSH. It<lb/> was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and
                    set<lb/> down upon the ground. The children were then<lb/> called, like so many
                    pigs, and like so many pigs they<lb/> would come and devour the mush; some with
                    oyster-<lb/> shells, others with pieces of shingle, some with naked<lb/> hands,
                    and none with spoons. He that ate fastest<lb/> got most; he that was strongest
                    secured the best<lb/> place; and few left the trough satisfied.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was probably between seven and eight years old<lb/> when I left Colonel Lloyd's
                    plantation. I left it with<lb/> joy. I shall never forget the ecstasy with which
                    I<lb/> received the intelligence that my old master (An-<lb/> thony) had
                    determined to let me go to Baltimore,<lb/> to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, brother
                    to my old<lb/> master's son-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld. I re-<lb/> ceived this
                    information about three days before my<lb/> departure. They were three of the
                    happiest days<lb/> I ever enjoyed. I spent the most part of all these<lb/> three
                    days in the creek, washing off the plantation<lb/> scurf, and preparing myself
                    for my departure.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The pride of appearance which this would indicate<lb/> was not my own. I spent
                    the time in washing, not so<lb/> much because I wished to, but because Mrs.<lb/>
                    Lucretia had told me I must get all the dead skin<lb/> off my feet and knees
                    before I could go to Balti-<lb/> more; for the people in Baltimore were very
                    cleanly,<lb/> and would laugh at me if I looked dirty. Besides,<lb/> she was
                    going to give me a pair of trousers, which I<lb/> should not put on unless I got
                    all the dirt off me.<lb/> The thought of owning a pair of trousers was
                    great<lb/> indeed! It was almost a sufficient motive, not only<lb/> to make me
                    take off what would be called by pig-<lb/> drovers the mange, but the skin
                    itself. I went at it<lb/> in good earnest, working for the first time with
                    the<lb/> hope of reward.<lb/>
                    <pb n="31"/>
                </p>
                <p>The ties that ordinarily bind children to their<lb/> homes were all suspended in
                    my case. I found no<lb/> severe trial in my departure. My home was charm-<lb/>
                    less; it was not home to me; on parting from it, I<lb/> could not feel that I
                    was leaving any thing which I<lb/> could have enjoyed by staying. My mother was
                    dead,<lb/> my grandmother lived far off, so that I seldom saw<lb/> her. I had
                    two sisters and one brother, that lived in<lb/> the same house with me; but the
                    early separation of<lb/> us from our mother had well nigh blotted the fact<lb/>
                    of our relationship from our memories. I looked for<lb/> home elsewhere, and was
                    confident of finding none<lb/> which I should relish less than the one which I
                    was<lb/> leaving. If, however, I found in my new home hard-<lb/> ship, hunger,
                    whipping, and nakedness, I had the<lb/> consolation that I should not have
                    escaped any one<lb/> of them by staying. Having already had more than<lb/> a
                    taste of them in the house of my old master, and<lb/> having endured them there,
                    I very naturally inferred<lb/> my ability to endure them elsewhere, and
                    especially<lb/> at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling<lb/> about
                    Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb,<lb/> that "being hanged in England
                    is preferable to<lb/> dying a natural death in Ireland." I had the
                    strongest<lb/> desire to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom, though not<lb/> fluent in
                    speech, had inspired me with that desire<lb/> by his eloquent description of the
                    place. I could<lb/> never point out any thing at the Great House, no<lb/> matter
                    how beautiful or powerful, but that he had<lb/> seen something at Baltimore far
                    exceeding, both in<lb/> beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out<lb/>
                    to him. Even the Great House itself, with all its<lb/> pictures, was far
                    inferior to many buildings in Bal-<lb/> timore. So strong was my desire, that I
                    thought a<lb/> gratification of it would fully compensate for what-<lb/> ever
                    loss of comforts I should sustain by the ex-<lb/>
                    <pb n="32"/> change. I left without a regret, and with the highest<lb/> hopes of
                    future happiness.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a<lb/> Saturday morning. I remember
                    only the day of the<lb/> week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the<lb/>
                    days of the month, nor the months of the year. On<lb/> setting sail, I walked
                    aft, and gave to Colonel Lloyd's<lb/> plantation what I hoped would be the last
                    look. I<lb/> then placed myself in the bows of the sloop, and<lb/> there spent
                    the remainder of the day in looking<lb/> ahead, interesting myself in what was
                    in the distance<lb/> rather than in things near by or behind.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In the afternoon of that day, we reached Annap-<lb/> olis, the capital of the
                    State. We stopped but a<lb/> few moments, so that I had no time to go on
                    shore.<lb/> It was the first large town that I had ever seen, and<lb/> though it
                    would look small compared with some of<lb/> our New England factory villages, I
                    thought it a<lb/> wonderful place for its sizeâ€” more imposing even<lb/>
                    than the Great House Farm!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morn-<lb/> ing, landing at Smith's Wharf,
                    not far from Bow-<lb/> ley's Wharf. We had on board the sloop a large<lb/> flock
                    of sheep; and after aiding in driving them to<lb/> the slaughterhouse of Mr.
                    Curtis on Louden Slater's<lb/> Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the
                    hands<lb/> belonging on board of the sloop, to my new home<lb/> in Alliciana
                    Street, near Mr. Gardner's ship-yard, on<lb/> Fells Point.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met<lb/> me at the door with their
                    little son Thomas, to take<lb/> care of whom I had been given. And here I saw
                    what<lb/> I had never seen before; it was a white face beaming<lb/> with the
                    most kindly emotions; it was the face of<lb/> my new mistress, Sophia Auld. I
                    wish I could de-<lb/> scribe the rapture that flashed through my soul as I<lb/>
                    beheld it. It was a new and strange sight to me,<lb/>
                    <pb n="33"/> brightening up my pathway with the light of happi-<lb/> ness.
                    Little Thomas was told, there was his Freddy,<lb/>â€” and I was told to
                    take care of little Thomas; and<lb/> thus I entered upon the duties of my new
                    home with<lb/> the most cheering prospect ahead.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd's<lb/> plantation as one of the most
                    interesting events of<lb/> my life. It is possible, and even quite probable,
                    that<lb/> but for the mere circumstance of being removed<lb/> from that
                    plantation to Baltimore, I should have<lb/> to-day, instead of being here seated
                    by my own table,<lb/> in the enjoyment of freedom and the happiness of<lb/>
                    home, writing this Narrative, been confined in the<lb/> galling chains of
                    slavery. Going to live at Baltimore<lb/> laid the foundation, and opened the
                    gateway, to all<lb/> my subsequent prosperity. I have ever regarded it<lb/> as
                    the first plain manifestation of that kind provi-<lb/> dence which has ever
                    since attended me, and marked<lb/> my life with so many favors. I regarded the
                    selection<lb/> of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were<lb/> a number
                    of slave children that might have been<lb/> sent from the plantation to
                    Baltimore. There were<lb/> those younger, those older, and those of the
                    same<lb/> age. I was chosen from among them all, and was<lb/> the first, last,
                    and only choice.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotisti-<lb/> cal, in regarding this
                    event as a special interposition<lb/> of divine Providence in my favor. But I
                    should be<lb/> false to the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I sup-<lb/>
                    pressed the opinion. I prefer to be true to myself,<lb/> even at the hazard of
                    incurring the ridicule of others,<lb/> rather than to be false, and incur my own
                    abhor-<lb/> rence. From my earliest recollection, I date the en-<lb/>
                    tertainment of a deep conviction that slavery would<lb/> not always be able to
                    hold me within its foul em-<lb/> brace; and in the darkest hours of my career in
                    slav-<lb/> ery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope de-<lb/>
                    <pb n="34"/> parted not from me, but remained like ministering<lb/> angels to
                    cheer me through the gloom. This good<lb/> spirit was from God, and to him I
                    offer thanksgiving<lb/> and praise.<lb/>

                <p>My new mistress proved to be all she appeared<lb/> when I first met her at the
                    door,â€” a woman of the<lb/> kindest heart and finest feelings. She had
                    never had<lb/> a slave under her control previously to myself, and<lb/> prior to
                    her marriage she had been dependent upon<lb/> her own industry for a living. She
                    was by trade a<lb/> weaver; and by constant application to her business,<lb/>
                    she had been in a good degree preserved from the<lb/> blighting and dehumanizing
                    effects of slavery. I was<lb/> utterly astonished at her goodness. I scarcely
                    knew<lb/> how to behave towards her. She was entirely unlike<lb/> any other
                    white woman I had ever seen. I could not<lb/> approach her as I was accustomed
                    to approach other<lb/> white ladies. My early instruction was all out of<lb/>
                    place. The crouching servility, usually so acceptable<lb/> a quality in a slave,
                    did not answer when manifested<lb/> toward her. Her favor was not gained by it;
                    she<lb/> seemed to be disturbed by it. She did not deem it<lb/> impudent or
                    unmannerly for a slave to look her in<lb/> the face. The meanest slave was put
                    fully at ease<lb/> in her presence, and none left without feeling bet-<lb/> ter
                    for having seen her. Her face was made of heav-<lb/> enly smiles, and her voice
                    of tranquil music.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>But, alas! this kind heart had but a short time to<lb/> remain such. The fatal
                    poison of irresponsible power<lb/> was already in her hands, and soon commenced
                    its<lb/> infernal work. That cheerful eye, under the influ-<lb/> ence of
                    slavery, soon became red with rage; that<lb/> voice, made all of sweet accord,
                    changed to one of<lb/>
                    <pb n="36"/> harsh and horrid discord; and that angelic face gave<lb/> place to
                    that of a demon.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs.<lb/> Auld, she very kindly
                    commenced to teach me the<lb/> A, B, C. After I had learned this, she assisted
                    me in<lb/> learning to spell words of three or four letters. Just<lb/> at this
                    point of my progress, Mr. Auld found out<lb/> what was going on, and at once
                    forbade Mrs. Auld<lb/> to instruct me further, telling her, among other<lb/>
                    things, that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to<lb/> teach a slave to read.
                    To use his own words, further,<lb/> he said, "If you give a nigger an inch, he
                    will take<lb/> an ell. A nigger should know nothing but to obey<lb/> his master
                   â€” to do as he is told to do. Learning would<lb/> SPOIL the best nigger in
                    the world. Now," said he, "if<lb/> you teach that nigger (speaking of myself)
                    how to<lb/> read, there would be no keeping him. It would for-<lb/> ever unfit
                    him to be a slave. He would at once be-<lb/> come unmanageable, and of no value
                    to his master.<lb/> As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great<lb/>
                    deal of harm. It would make him discontented and<lb/> unhappy." These words sank
                    deep into my heart,<lb/> stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering,<lb/>
                    and called into existence an entirely new train of<lb/> thought. It was a new
                    and special revelation, ex-<lb/> plaining dark and mysterious things, with which
                    my<lb/> youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled<lb/> in vain. I now
                    understood what had been to me a<lb/> most perplexing difficultyâ€” to wit,
                    the white man's<lb/> power to enslave the black man. It was a grand<lb/>
                    achievement, and I prized it highly. From that mo-<lb/> ment, I understood the
                    pathway from slavery to free-<lb/> dom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it
                    at a<lb/> time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was sad-<lb/> dened by the
                    thought of losing the aid of my kind<lb/> mistress, I was gladdened by the
                    invaluable instruc-<lb/> tion which, by the merest accident, I had gained<lb/>
                    <pb n="37"/> from my master. Though conscious of the difficulty<lb/> of learning
                    without a teacher, I set out with high<lb/> hope, and a fixed purpose, at
                    whatever cost of trou-<lb/> ble, to learn how to read. The very decided
                    manner<lb/> with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife<lb/> with the
                    evil consequences of giving me instruction,<lb/> served to convince me that he
                    was deeply sensible<lb/> of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best<lb/>
                    assurance that I might rely with the utmost confi-<lb/> dence on the results
                    which, he said, would flow from<lb/> teaching me to read. What he most dreaded,
                    that<lb/> I most desired. What he most loved, that I most<lb/> hated. That which
                    to him was a great evil, to be<lb/> carefully shunned, was to me a great good,
                    to be<lb/> diligently sought; and the argument which he so<lb/> warmly urged,
                    against my learning to read, only<lb/> served to inspire me with a desire and
                    determina-<lb/> tion to learn. In learning to read, I owe almost as<lb/> much to
                    the bitter opposition of my master, as to<lb/> the kindly aid of my mistress. I
                    acknowledge the<lb/> benefit of both.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I had resided but a short time in Baltimore before<lb/> I observed a marked
                    difference, in the treatment of<lb/> slaves, from that which I had witnessed in
                    the coun-<lb/> try. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with<lb/> a slave
                    on the plantation. He is much better fed and<lb/> clothed, and enjoys privileges
                    altogether unknown<lb/> to the slave on the plantation. There is a vestige
                    of<lb/> decency, a sense of shame, that does much to curb<lb/> and check those
                    outbreaks of atrocious cruelty so<lb/> commonly enacted upon the plantation. He
                    is a des-<lb/> perate slaveholder, who will shock the humanity of<lb/> his
                    non-slaveholding neighbors with the cries of his<lb/> lacerated slave. Few are
                    willing to incur the odium<lb/> attaching to the reputation of being a cruel
                    master;<lb/> and above all things, they would not be known as<lb/> not giving a
                    slave enough to eat. Every city slave-<lb/>
                    <pb n="38"/> holder is anxious to have it known of him, that he<lb/> feeds his
                    slaves well; and it is due to them to say,<lb/> that most of them do give their
                    slaves enough to eat.<lb/> There are, however, some painful exceptions to
                    this<lb/> rule. Directly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived<lb/> Mr.
                    Thomas Hamilton. He owned two slaves. Their<lb/> names were Henrietta and Mary.
                    Henrietta was<lb/> about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about four-<lb/>
                    teen; and of all the mangled and emaciated creatures<lb/> I ever looked upon,
                    these two were the most so. His<lb/> heart must be harder than stone, that could
                    look<lb/> upon these unmoved. The head, neck, and shoulders<lb/> of Mary were
                    literally cut to pieces. I have fre-<lb/> quently felt her head, and found it
                    nearly covered<lb/> with festering sores, caused by the lash of her cruel<lb/>
                    mistress. I do not know that her master ever whipped<lb/> her, but I have been
                    an eye-witness to the cruelty of<lb/> Mrs. Hamilton. I used to be in Mr.
                    Hamilton's house<lb/> nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sit in a
                    large<lb/> chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cow-<lb/> skin always
                    by her side, and scarce an hour passed<lb/> during the day but was marked by the
                    blood of one<lb/> of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without<lb/> her
                    saying, "Move faster, you BLACK GIP!" at the same<lb/> time giving them a blow
                    with the cowskin over the<lb/> head or shoulders, often drawing the blood.
                    She<lb/> would then say, "Take that, you BLACK GIP!"â€” con-<lb/> tinuing,
                    "If you don't move faster, I'll move you!"<lb/> Added to the cruel lashings to
                    which these slaves<lb/> were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved.<lb/>
                    They seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal.<lb/> I have seen Mary
                    contending with the pigs for the<lb/> offal thrown into the street. So much was
                    Mary<lb/> kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftener called<lb/> "PECKED"
                    than by her name.<lb/>

                <p>I lived in Master Hugh's family about seven years.<lb/> During this time, I
                    succeeded in learning to read and<lb/> write. In accomplishing this, I was
                    compelled to re-<lb/> sort to various stratagems. I had no regular teacher.<lb/>
                    My mistress, who had kindly commenced to instruct<lb/> me, had, in compliance
                    with the advice and direc-<lb/> tion of her husband, not only ceased to
                    instruct, but<lb/> had set her face against my being instructed by any<lb/> one
                    else. It is due, however, to my mistress to say<lb/> of her, that she did not
                    adopt this course of treat-<lb/> ment immediately. She at first lacked the
                    depravity<lb/> indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness.<lb/> It was
                    at least necessary for her to have some training<lb/> in the exercise of
                    irresponsible power, to make her<lb/> equal to the task of treating me as though
                    I were<lb/> a brute.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-<lb/> hearted woman; and in
                    the simplicity of her soul she<lb/> commenced, when I first went to live with
                    her, to<lb/> treat me as she supposed one human being ought<lb/> to treat
                    another. In entering upon the duties of a<lb/> slaveholder, she did not seem to
                    perceive that I sus-<lb/> tained to her the relation of a mere chattel, and<lb/>
                    that for her to treat me as a human being was not<lb/> only wrong, but
                    dangerously so. Slavery proved as<lb/> injurious to her as it did to me. When I
                    went there,<lb/> she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman.<lb/> There was
                    no sorrow or suffering for which she had<lb/> not a tear. She had bread for the
                    hungry, clothes for<lb/> the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came<lb/>
                    <pb n="40"/> within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability to<lb/> divest
                    her of these heavenly qualities. Under its in-<lb/> fluence, the tender heart
                    became stone, and the<lb/> lamblike disposition gave way to one of
                    tiger-like<lb/> fierceness. The first step in her downward course was<lb/> in
                    her ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced<lb/> to practise her husband's
                    precepts. She finally be-<lb/> came even more violent in her opposition than
                    her<lb/> husband himself. She was not satisfied with simply<lb/> doing as well
                    as he had commanded; she seemed<lb/> anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to
                    make her<lb/> more angry than to see me with a newspaper. She<lb/> seemed to
                    think that here lay the danger. I have had<lb/> her rush at me with a face made
                    all up of fury, and<lb/> snatch from me a newspaper, in a manner that fully<lb/>
                    revealed her apprehension. She was an apt woman;<lb/> and a little experience
                    soon demonstrated, to her<lb/> satisfaction, that education and slavery were
                    incom-<lb/> patible with each other.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I<lb/> was in a separate room any
                    considerable length of<lb/> time, I was sure to be suspected of having a
                    book,<lb/> and was at once called to give an account of myself.<lb/> All this,
                    however, was too late. The first step had<lb/> been taken. Mistress, in teaching
                    me the alphabet,<lb/> had given me the INCH, and no precaution could pre-<lb/>
                    vent me from taking the ELL.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The plan which I adopted, and the one by which<lb/> I was most successful, was
                    that of making friends of<lb/> all the little white boys whom I met in the
                    street.<lb/> As many of these as I could, I converted into teach-<lb/> ers. With
                    their kindly aid, obtained at different times<lb/> and in different places, I
                    finally succeeded in learn-<lb/> ing to read. When I was sent of errands, I
                    always<lb/> took my book with me, and by going one part of<lb/> my errand
                    quickly, I found time to get a lesson be-<lb/> fore my return. I used also to
                    carry bread with me,<lb/>
                    <pb n="41"/> enough of which was always in the house, and to<lb/> which I was
                    always welcome; for I was much better<lb/> off in this regard than many of the
                    poor white chil-<lb/> dren in our neighborhood. This bread I used to be-<lb/>
                    stow upon the hungry little urchins, who, in return,<lb/> would give me that
                    more valuable bread of knowl-<lb/> edge. I am strongly tempted to give the names
                    of<lb/> two or three of those little boys, as a testimonial of<lb/> the
                    gratitude and affection I bear them; but pru-<lb/> dence forbids;â€” not
                    that it would injure me, but it<lb/> might embarrass them; for it is almost an
                    unpar-<lb/> donable offence to teach slaves to read in this Chris-<lb/> tian
                    country. It is enough to say of the dear little<lb/> fellows, that they lived on
                    Philpot Street, very near<lb/> Durgin and Bailey's ship-yard. I used to talk
                    this<lb/> matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes<lb/> say to them,
                    I wished I could be as free as they<lb/> would be when they got to be men. "You
                    will be<lb/> free as soon as you are twenty-one, BUT I AM A SLAVE<lb/> FOR LIFE!
                    Have not I as good a right to be free as<lb/> you have?" These words used to
                    trouble them; they<lb/> would express for me the liveliest sympathy, and
                    con-<lb/> sole me with the hope that something would occur<lb/> by which I might
                    be free.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was now about twelve years old, and the thought<lb/> of being A SLAVE FOR LIFE
                    began to bear heavily upon<lb/> my heart. Just about this time, I got hold of a
                    book<lb/> entitled "The Columbian Orator." Every opportu-<lb/> nity I got, I
                    used to read this book. Among much of<lb/> other interesting matter, I found in
                    it a dialogue be-<lb/> tween a master and his slave. The slave was repre-<lb/>
                    sented as having run away from his master three<lb/> times. The dialogue
                    represented the conversation<lb/> which took place between them, when the slave
                    was<lb/> retaken the third time. In this dialogue, the whole<lb/> argument in
                    behalf of slavery was brought forward<lb/> by the master, all of which was
                    disposed of by the<lb/>
                    <pb n="42"/> slave. The slave was made to say some very smart as<lb/> well as
                    impressive things in reply to his masterâ€”<lb/> things which had the
                    desired though unexpected ef-<lb/> fect; for the conversation resulted in the
                    voluntary<lb/> emancipation of the slave on the part of the master.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan's<lb/> mighty speeches on and in
                    behalf of Catholic eman-<lb/> cipation. These were choice documents to me. I
                    read<lb/> them over and over again with unabated interest.<lb/> They gave tongue
                    to interesting thoughts of my own<lb/> soul, which had frequently flashed
                    through my mind,<lb/> and died away for want of utterance. The moral<lb/> which
                    I gained from the dialogue was the power of<lb/> truth over the conscience of
                    even a slaveholder. What<lb/> I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of
                    slav-<lb/> ery, and a powerful vindication of human rights.<lb/> The reading of
                    these documents enabled me to<lb/> utter my thoughts, and to meet the
                    arguments<lb/> brought forward to sustain slavery; but while they<lb/> relieved
                    me of one difficulty, they brought on an-<lb/> other even more painful than the
                    one of which I was<lb/> relieved. The more I read, the more I was led to<lb/>
                    abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them<lb/> in no other light than a
                    band of successful robbers,<lb/> who had left their homes, and gone to Africa,
                    and<lb/> stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land<lb/> reduced us to
                    slavery. I loathed them as being the<lb/> meanest as well as the most wicked of
                    men. As I<lb/> read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very<lb/>
                    discontentment which Master Hugh had predicted<lb/> would follow my learning to
                    read had already come,<lb/> to torment and sting my soul to unutterable
                    anguish.<lb/> As I writhed under it, I would at times feel that<lb/> learning to
                    read had been a curse rather than a bless-<lb/> ing. It had given me a view of
                    my wretched condi-<lb/> tion, without the remedy. It opened my eyes to the<lb/>
                    horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out.<lb/>
                    <pb n="43"/> In moments of agony, I envied my fellow-slaves for<lb/> their
                    stupidity. I have often wished myself a beast.<lb/> I preferred the condition of
                    the meanest reptile to<lb/> my own. Any thing, no matter what, to get rid
                    of<lb/> thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of my con-<lb/> dition that
                    tormented me. There was no getting rid<lb/> of it. It was pressed upon me by
                    every object within<lb/> sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silver<lb/>
                    trump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal<lb/> wakefulness. Freedom now
                    appeared, to disappear<lb/> no more forever. It was heard in every sound,
                    and<lb/> seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment<lb/> me with a
                    sense of my wretched condition. I saw<lb/> nothing without seeing it, I heard
                    nothing without<lb/> hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It<lb/>
                    looked from every star, it smiled in every calm,<lb/> breathed in every wind,
                    and moved in every storm.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I often found myself regretting my own existence,<lb/> and wishing myself dead;
                    and but for the hope of<lb/> being free, I have no doubt but that I should
                    have<lb/> killed myself, or done something for which I should<lb/> have been
                    killed. While in this state of mind, I was<lb/> eager to hear any one speak of
                    slavery. I was a ready<lb/> listener. Every little while, I could hear
                    something<lb/> about the abolitionists. It was some time before I<lb/> found
                    what the word meant. It was always used in<lb/> such connections as to make it
                    an interesting word<lb/> to me. If a slave ran away and succeeded in
                    getting<lb/> clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a<lb/> barn, or
                    did any thing very wrong in the mind of a<lb/> slaveholder, it was spoken of as
                    the fruit of ABOLITION.<lb/> Hearing the word in this connection very often, I
                    set<lb/> about learning what it meant. The dictionary af-<lb/> forded me little
                    or no help. I found it was "the act<lb/> of abolishing;" but then I did not know
                    what was<lb/> to be abolished. Here I was perplexed. I did not<lb/> dare to ask
                    any one about its meaning, for I was<lb/>
                    <pb n="44"/> satisfied that it was something they wanted me to<lb/> know very
                    little about. After a patient waiting, I got<lb/> one of our city papers,
                    containing an account of the<lb/> number of petitions from the north, praying
                    for the<lb/> abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and<lb/> of the
                    slave trade between the States. From this<lb/> time I understood the words
                    ABOLITION and ABOLITION-<lb/> IST, and always drew near when that word was
                    spoken,<lb/> expecting to hear something of importance to my-<lb/> self and
                    fellow-slaves. The light broke in upon me<lb/> by degrees. I went one day down
                    on the wharf of<lb/> Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a<lb/> scow
                    of stone, I went, unasked, and helped them.<lb/> When we had finished, one of
                    them came to me<lb/> and asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He<lb/>
                    asked, "Are ye a slave for life?" I told him that I<lb/> was. The good Irishman
                    seemed to be deeply af-<lb/> fected by the statement. He said to the other
                    that<lb/> it was a pity so fine a little fellow as myself should<lb/> be a slave
                    for life. He said it was a shame to hold<lb/> me. They both advised me to run
                    away to the north;<lb/> that I should find friends there, and that I should<lb/>
                    be free. I pretended not to be interested in what<lb/> they said, and treated
                    them as if I did not under-<lb/> stand them; for I feared they might be
                    treacherous.<lb/> White men have been known to encourage slaves to<lb/> escape,
                    and then, to get the reward, catch them and<lb/> return them to their masters. I
                    was afraid that these<lb/> seemingly good men might use me so; but I never-<lb/>
                    theless remembered their advice, and from that time<lb/> I resolved to run away.
                    I looked forward to a time<lb/> at which it would be safe for me to escape. I
                    was<lb/> too young to think of doing so immediately; besides,<lb/> I wished to
                    learn how to write, as I might have oc-<lb/> casion to write my own pass. I
                    consoled myself with<lb/> the hope that I should one day find a good
                    chance.<lb/> Meanwhile, I would learn to write.<lb/>
                    <pb n="45"/>
                </p>
                <p>The idea as to how I might learn to write was<lb/> suggested to me by being in
                    Durgin and Bailey's<lb/> ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship
                    carpenters,<lb/> after hewing, and getting a piece of timber ready<lb/> for use,
                    write on the timber the name of that part<lb/> of the ship for which it was
                    intended. When a piece<lb/> of timber was intended for the larboard side,
                    it<lb/> would be marked thusâ€” "L." When a piece was for<lb/> the
                    starboard side, it would be marked thusâ€” "S." A<lb/> piece for the
                    larboard side forward, would be marked<lb/> thusâ€” "L. F." When a piece
                    was for starboard side<lb/> forward, it would be marked thusâ€” "S. F." For
                    lar-<lb/> board aft, it would be marked thusâ€” "L. A." For star-<lb/>
                    board aft, it would be marked thusâ€” "S. A." I soon<lb/> learned the names
                    of these letters, and for what<lb/> they were intended when placed upon a piece
                    of<lb/> timber in the ship-yard. I immediately commenced<lb/> copying them, and
                    in a short time was able to make<lb/> the four letters named. After that, when I
                    met with<lb/> any boy who I knew could write, I would tell him<lb/> I could
                    write as well as he. The next word would be,<lb/> "I don't believe you. Let me
                    see you try it." I would<lb/> then make the letters which I had been so
                    fortunate<lb/> as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I<lb/> got a
                    good many lessons in writing, which it is quite<lb/> possible I should never
                    have gotten in any other way.<lb/> During this time, my copy-book was the board
                    fence,<lb/> brick wall, and pavement; my pen and ink was a<lb/> lump of chalk.
                    With these, I learned mainly how to<lb/> write. I then commenced and continued
                    copying the<lb/> Italics in Webster's Spelling Book, until I could make<lb/>
                    them all without looking on the book. By this time,<lb/> my little Master Thomas
                    had gone to school, and<lb/> learned how to write, and had written over a
                    number<lb/> of copy-books. These had been brought home, and<lb/> shown to some
                    of our near neighbors, and then laid<lb/> aside. My mistress used to go to class
                    meeting at<lb/>
                    <pb n="46"/> the Wilk Street meetinghouse every Monday after-<lb/> noon, and
                    leave me to take care of the house. When<lb/> left thus, I used to spend the
                    time in writing in the<lb/> spaces left in Master Thomas's copy-book,
                    copying<lb/> what he had written. I continued to do this until I<lb/> could
                    write a hand very similar to that of Master<lb/> Thomas. Thus, after a long,
                    tedious effort for years,<lb/> I finally succeeded in learning how to write.<lb/>

                <lb/>
                <p>In a very short time after I went to live at Balti-<lb/> more, my old master's
                    youngest son Richard died;<lb/> and in about three years and six months after
                    his<lb/> death, my old master, Captain Anthony, died, leav-<lb/> only his son,
                    Andrew, and daughter, Lucretia, to<lb/> share his estate. He died while on a
                    visit to see his<lb/> daughter at Hillsborough. Cut off thus unexpectedly,<lb/>
                    he left no will as to the disposal of his property. It<lb/> was therefore
                    necessary to have a valuation of the<lb/> property, that it might be equally
                    divided between<lb/> Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew. I was immedi-<lb/> ately
                    sent for, to be valued with the other property.<lb/> Here again my feelings rose
                    up in detestation of<lb/> slavery. I had now a new conception of my
                    degraded<lb/> condition. Prior to this, I had become, if not in-<lb/> sensible
                    to my lot, at least partly so. I left Baltimore<lb/> with a young heart
                    overborne with sadness, and a<lb/> soul full of apprehension. I took passage
                    with Cap-<lb/> tain Rowe, in the schooner Wild Cat, and, after a<lb/> sail of
                    about twenty-four hours, I found myself near<lb/> the place of my birth. I had
                    now been absent from<lb/> it almost, if not quite, five years. I, however,
                    re-<lb/> membered the place very well. I was only about<lb/> five years old when
                    I left it, to go and live with my<lb/> old master on Colonel Lloyd's plantation;
                    so that<lb/> I was now between ten and eleven years old.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We were all ranked together at the valuation. Men<lb/> and women, old and young,
                    married and single, were<lb/> ranked with horses, sheep, and swine. There
                    were<lb/> horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and chil-<lb/>
                    <pb n="48"/> dren, all holding the same rank in the scale of being,<lb/> and
                    were all subjected to the same narrow examina-<lb/> tion. Silvery-headed age and
                    sprightly youth, maids<lb/> and matrons, had to undergo the same indelicate<lb/>
                    inspection. At this moment, I saw more clearly than<lb/> ever the brutalizing
                    effects of slavery upon both<lb/> slave and slaveholder.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>After the valuation, then came the division. I have<lb/> no language to express
                    the high excitement and deep<lb/> anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves
                    during<lb/> this time. Our fate for life was now to be decided.<lb/> we had no
                    more voice in that decision than the<lb/> brutes among whom we were ranked. A
                    single word<lb/> from the white men was enoughâ€” against all our<lb/>
                    wishes, prayers, and entreatiesâ€” to sunder forever the<lb/> dearest
                    friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties<lb/> known to human beings. In
                    addition to the pain of<lb/> separation, there was the horrid dread of falling
                    into<lb/> the hands of Master Andrew. He was known to us<lb/> all as being a
                    most cruel wretch,â€” a common drunk-<lb/> ard, who had, by his reckless
                    mismanagement and<lb/> profligate dissipation, already wasted a large por-<lb/>
                    tion of his father's property. We all felt that we<lb/> might as well be sold at
                    once to the Georgia traders,<lb/> as to pass into his hands; for we knew that
                    that<lb/> would be our inevitable condition,â€” a condition held<lb/> by us
                    all in the utmost horror and dread.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-<lb/> slaves. I had known what it
                    was to be kindly treated;<lb/> they had known nothing of the kind. They had
                    seen<lb/> little or nothing of the world. They were in very<lb/> deed men and
                    women of sorrow, and acquainted with<lb/> grief. Their backs had been made
                    familiar with the<lb/> bloody lash, so that they had become callous; mine<lb/>
                    was yet tender; for while at Baltimore I got few whip-<lb/> pings, and few
                    slaves could boast of a kinder master<lb/> and mistress than myself; and the
                    thought of pass-<lb/>
                    <pb n="49"/> ing out of their hands into those of Master Andrewâ€”<lb/> a
                    man who, but a few days before, to give me a<lb/> sample of his bloody
                    disposition, took my little<lb/> brother by the throat, threw him on the ground,
                    and<lb/> with the heel of his boot stamped upon his head<lb/> till the blood
                    gushed from his nose and earsâ€” was<lb/> well calculated to make me
                    anxious as to my fate.<lb/> After he had committed this savage outrage upon<lb/>
                    my brother, he turned to me, and said that was the<lb/> way he meant to serve me
                    one of these days,â€” mean-<lb/> ing, I suppose, when I came into his
                    possession.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Thanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion<lb/> of Mrs. Lucretia, and was
                    sent immediately back<lb/> to Baltimore, to live again in the family of
                    Master<lb/> Hugh. Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow<lb/> at my
                    departure. It was a glad day to me. I had<lb/> escaped a worse than lion's jaws.
                    I was absent from<lb/> Baltimore, for the purpose of valuation and
                    division,<lb/> just about one month, and it seemed to have been<lb/> six.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Very soon after my return to Baltimore, my mis-<lb/> tress, Lucretia, died,
                    leaving her husband and one<lb/> child, Amanda; and in a very short time after
                    her<lb/> death, Master Andrew died. Now all the property<lb/> of my old master,
                    slaves included, was in the hands<lb/> of strangers,â€” strangers who had
                    had nothing to do<lb/> with accumulating it. Not a slave was left free. All<lb/>
                    remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest. If<lb/> any one thing in my
                    experience, more than another,<lb/> served to deepen my conviction of the
                    infernal char-<lb/> acter of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable<lb/>
                    loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingrati-<lb/> tude to my poor old
                    grandmother. She had served<lb/> my old master faithfully from youth to old age.
                    She<lb/> had been the source of all his wealth; she had peo-<lb/> pled his
                    plantation with slaves; she had become a<lb/> great grandmother in his service.
                    She had rocked<lb/>
                    <pb n="50"/> him in infancy, attended him in childhood, served<lb/> him through
                    life, and at his death wiped from his<lb/> icy brow the cold death-sweat, and
                    closed his eyes<lb/> forever. She was nevertheless left a slaveâ€” a slave
                    for<lb/> lifeâ€” a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their<lb/> hands
                    she saw her children, her grandchildren, and<lb/> her great-grandchildren,
                    divided, like so many sheep,<lb/> without being gratified with the small
                    privilege of a<lb/> single word, as to their or her own destiny. And, to<lb/>
                    cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish<lb/> barbarity, my
                    grandmother, who was now very old,<lb/> having outlived my old master and all
                    his children,<lb/> having seen the beginning and end of all of them,<lb/> and
                    her present owners finding she was of but little<lb/> value, her frame already
                    racked with the pains of old<lb/> age, and complete helplessness fast stealing
                    over her<lb/> once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built<lb/> her a
                    little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and<lb/> then made her welcome to the
                    privilege of support-<lb/> ing herself there in perfect loneliness; thus
                    virtually<lb/> turning her out to die! If my poor old grandmother<lb/> now
                    lives, she lives to suffer in utter loneliness; she<lb/> lives to remember and
                    mourn over the loss of chil-<lb/> dren, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss
                    of great-<lb/> grandchildren. They are, in the language of the<lb/> slave's
                    poet, Whittier,â€”<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>"Gone, gone, sold and gone<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>To the rice swamp dank and lone,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Where the noisome insect stings,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Where the fever-demon strews<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Poison with the falling dews,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Where the sickly sunbeams glare<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Through the hot and misty air:â€”<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Gone, gone, sold and gone<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> To the rice swamp dank and lone,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> From Virginia hills and watersâ€”<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Woe is me, my stolen daughters!"<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The hearth is desolate. The children, the uncon-<lb/> scious children, who once
                    sang and danced in her<lb/> presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in the
                    dark-<lb/> ness of age, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices<lb/> of her
                    children, she hears by day the moans of the<lb/> dove, and by night the screams
                    of the hideous owl.<lb/> All is gloom. The grave is at the door. And now,<lb/>
                    when weighed down by the pains and aches of old<lb/> age, when the head inclines
                    to the feet, when the<lb/> beginning and ending of human existence meet,
                    and<lb/> helpless infancy and painful old age combine to-<lb/> getherâ€” at
                    this time, this most needful time, the time<lb/> for the exercise of that
                    tenderness and affection<lb/> which children only can exercise towards a
                    declining<lb/> parentâ€” my poor old grandmother, the devoted<lb/> mother
                    of twelve children, is left all alone, in yonder<lb/> little hut, before a few
                    dim embers. She standsâ€”<lb/> she sitsâ€” she staggersâ€” she
                    fallsâ€” she groansâ€” she dies<lb/>â€” and there are none of her
                    children or grandchildren<lb/> present, to wipe from her wrinkled brow the
                    cold<lb/> sweat of death, or to place beneath the sod her<lb/> fallen remains.
                    Will not a righteous God visit for<lb/> these things?<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In about two years after the death of Mrs. Lu-<lb/> cretia, Master Thomas married
                    his second wife. Her<lb/> name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the eldest<lb/>
                    daughter of Mr. William Hamilton. Master now<lb/> lived in St. Michael's. Not
                    long after his marriage,<lb/> a misunderstanding took place between himself
                    and<lb/> Master Hugh; and as a means of punishing his<lb/> brother, he took me
                    from him to live with himself<lb/> at St. Michael's. Here I underwent another
                    most<lb/> painful separation. It, however, was not so severe<lb/> as the one I
                    dreaded at the division of property; for,<lb/>
                    <pb n="52"/> during this interval, a great change had taken place<lb/> in Master
                    Hugh and his once kind and affectionate<lb/> wife. The influence of brandy upon
                    him, and of<lb/> slavery upon her, had effected a disastrous change<lb/> in the
                    characters of both; so that, as far as they<lb/> were concerned, I thought I had
                    little to lose by the<lb/> change. But it was not to them that I was
                    attached.<lb/> It was to those little Baltimore boys that I felt the<lb/>
                    strongest attachment. I had received many good<lb/> lessons from them, and was
                    still receiving them, and<lb/> the thought of leaving them was painful indeed.
                    I<lb/> was leaving, too, without the hope of ever being<lb/> allowed to return.
                    Master Thomas had said he would<lb/> never let me return again. The barrier
                    betwixt him-<lb/> self and brother he considered impassable.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I then had to regret that I did not at least make<lb/> the attempt to carry out
                    my resolution to run away;<lb/> for the chances of success are tenfold greater
                    from<lb/> the city than from the country.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I sailed from Baltimore for St. Michael's in the<lb/> sloop Amanda, Captain
                    Edward Dodson. On my<lb/> passage, I paid particular attention to the
                    direction<lb/> which the steamboats took to go to Philadelphia. I<lb/> found,
                    instead of going down, on reaching North<lb/> Point they went up the bay, in a
                    north-easterly direc-<lb/> tion. I deemed this knowledge of the utmost im-<lb/>
                    portance. My determination to run away was again<lb/> revived. I resolved to
                    wait only so long as the offering<lb/> of a favorable opportunity. When that
                    came, I was<lb/> determined to be off.<lb/>

                </head>
                <p>I have now reached a period of my life when I<lb/> can give dates. I left
                    Baltimore, and went to live<lb/> with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael's,
                    in<lb/> March, 1832. It was now more than seven years<lb/> since I lived with
                    him in the family of my old mas-<lb/> ter, on Colonel Lloyd's plantation. We of
                    course<lb/> were now almost entire strangers to each other. He<lb/> was to me a
                    new master, and I to him a new slave.<lb/> I was ignorant of his temper and
                    disposition; he<lb/> was equally so of mine. A very short time, however,<lb/>
                    brought us into full acquaintance with each other.<lb/> I was made acquainted
                    with his wife not less than<lb/> with himself. They were well matched, being
                    equally<lb/> mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time during<lb/> a space
                    of more than seven years, made to feel the<lb/> painful gnawings of hunger
                   â€” a something which I<lb/> had not experienced before since I left
                    Colonel<lb/> Lloyd's plantation. It went hard enough with me<lb/> then, when I
                    could look back to no period at which<lb/> I had enjoyed a sufficiency. It was
                    tenfold harder<lb/> after living in Master Hugh's family, where I had<lb/>
                    always had enough to eat, and of that which was<lb/> good. I have said Master
                    Thomas was a mean man.<lb/> He was so. Not to give a slave enough to eat,
                    is<lb/> regarded as the most aggravated development of<lb/> meanness even among
                    slaveholders. The rule is, no<lb/> matter how coarse the food, only let there be
                    enough<lb/> of it. This is the theory; and in the part of Maryland<lb/> from
                    which I came, it is the general practice,â€” though<lb/> there are many
                    exceptions. Master Thomas gave us<lb/>
                    <pb n="54"/> enough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were<lb/> four slaves
                    of us in the kitchenâ€” my sister Eliza, my<lb/> aunt Priscilla, Henny, and
                    myself; and we were al-<lb/> lowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal
                    per<lb/> week, and very little else, either in the shape of<lb/> meat or
                    vegetables. It was not enough for us to<lb/> subsist upon. We were therefore
                    reduced to the<lb/> wretched necessity of living at the expense of our<lb/>
                    neighbors. This we did by begging and stealing,<lb/> whichever came handy in the
                    time of need, the one<lb/> being considered as legitimate as the other. A
                    great<lb/> many times have we poor creatures been nearly<lb/> perishing with
                    hunger, when food in abundance lay<lb/> mouldering in the safe and smoke-house,
                    and our<lb/> pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that<lb/> mistress
                    and her husband would kneel every morn-<lb/> ing, and pray that God would bless
                    them in basket<lb/> and store!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one<lb/> destitute of every element
                    of character commanding<lb/> respect. My master was one of this rare sort. I
                    do<lb/> not know of one single noble act ever performed by<lb/> him. The leading
                    trait in his character was mean-<lb/> ness; and if there were any other element
                    in his<lb/> nature, it was made subject to this. He was mean;<lb/> and, like
                    most other mean men, he lacked the ability<lb/> to conceal his meanness. Captain
                    Auld was not born<lb/> a slaveholder. He had been a poor man, master only<lb/>
                    of a Bay craft. He came into possession of all his<lb/> slaves by marriage; and
                    of all men, adopted slave-<lb/> holders are the worst. He was cruel, but
                    cowardly.<lb/> He commanded without firmness. In the enforce-<lb/> ment of his
                    rules, he was at times rigid, and at times<lb/> lax. At times, he spoke to his
                    slaves with the firmness<lb/> of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other
                    times,<lb/> he might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had<lb/> lost his way.
                    He did nothing of himself. He might<lb/>
                    <pb n="55"/> have passed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things<lb/> noble
                    which he attempted, his own meanness shone<lb/> most conspicuous. His airs,
                    words, and actions,<lb/> were the airs, words, and actions of born slave-<lb/>
                    holders, and, being assumed, were awkward enough.<lb/> He was not even a good
                    imitator. He possessed all<lb/> the disposition to deceive, but wanted the
                    power.<lb/> Having no resources within himself, he was com-<lb/> pelled to be
                    the copyist of many, and being such, he<lb/> was forever the victim of
                    inconsistency; and of con-<lb/> sequence he was an object of contempt, and was
                    held<lb/> as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having<lb/> slaves of his
                    own to wait upon him was something<lb/> new and unprepared for. He was a
                    slaveholder with-<lb/> out the ability to hold slaves. He found himself in-<lb/>
                    capable of managing his slaves either by force, fear,<lb/> or fraud. We seldom
                    called him "master;" we gen-<lb/> erally called him "Captain Auld," and were
                    hardly<lb/> disposed to title him at all. I doubt not that our<lb/> conduct had
                    much to do with making him appear<lb/> awkward, and of consequence fretful. Our
                    want of<lb/> reverence for him must have perplexed him greatly.<lb/> He wished
                    to have us call him master, but lacked<lb/> the firmness necessary to command us
                    to do so. His<lb/> wife used to insist upon our calling him so, but to<lb/> no
                    purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended a<lb/> Methodist camp-meeting held
                    in the Bay-side, Tal-<lb/> bot county, and there experienced religion. I
                    in-<lb/> dulged a faint hope that his conversion would lead<lb/> him to
                    emancipate his slaves, and that, if he did not<lb/> do this, it would, at any
                    rate, make him more kind<lb/> and humane. I was disappointed in both these
                    re-<lb/> spects. It neither made him to be humane to his<lb/> slaves, nor to
                    emancipate them. If it had any effect<lb/> on his character, it made him more
                    cruel and hateful<lb/> in all his ways; for I believe him to have been a
                    much<lb/> worse man after his conversion than before. Prior<lb/>
                    <pb n="56"/> to his conversion, he relied upon his own depravity<lb/> to shield
                    and sustain him in his savage barbarity;<lb/> but after his conversion, he found
                    religious sanction<lb/> and support for his slaveholding cruelty. He made<lb/>
                    the greatest pretensions to piety. His house was the<lb/> house of prayer. He
                    prayed morning, noon, and<lb/> night. He very soon distinguished himself
                    among<lb/> his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader and<lb/> exhorter. His
                    activity in revivals was great, and he<lb/> proved himself an instrument in the
                    hands of the<lb/> church in converting many souls. His house was the<lb/>
                    preachers' home. They used to take great pleasure<lb/> in coming there to put
                    up; for while he starved us, he<lb/> stuffed them. We have had three or four
                    preachers<lb/> there at a time. The names of those who used to<lb/> come most
                    frequently while I lived there, were Mr.<lb/> Storks, Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry,
                    and Mr. Hickey.<lb/> I have also seen Mr. George Cookman at our house.<lb/> We
                    slaves loved Mr. Cookman. We believed him to<lb/> be a good man. We thought him
                    instrumental in get-<lb/> ting Mr. Samuel Harrison, a very rich slaveholder,
                    to<lb/> emancipate his slaves; and by some means got the<lb/> impression that he
                    was laboring to effect the emanci-<lb/> pation of all the slaves. When he was at
                    our house,<lb/> we were sure to be called in to prayers. When the<lb/> others
                    were there, we were sometimes called in and<lb/> sometimes not. Mr. Cookman took
                    more notice of<lb/> us than either of the other ministers. He could not<lb/>
                    come among us without betraying his sympathy for<lb/> us, and, stupid as we
                    were, we had the sagacity to<lb/> see it.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>While I lived with my master in St. Michael's,<lb/> there was a white young man,
                    a Mr. Wilson, who<lb/> proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the
                    instruction<lb/> of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read<lb/> the
                    New Testament. We met but three times, when<lb/> Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks,
                    both class-leaders,<lb/>
                    <pb n="57"/> with many others, came upon us with sticks and<lb/> other missiles,
                    drove us off, and forbade us to meet<lb/> again. Thus ended our little Sabbath
                    school in the<lb/> pious town of St. Michael's.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have said my master found religious sanction<lb/> for his cruelty. As an
                    example, I will state one of<lb/> many facts going to prove the charge. I have
                    seen<lb/> him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with<lb/> a heavy cowskin
                    upon her naked shoulders, causing<lb/> the warm red blood to drip; and, in
                    justification<lb/> of the bloody deed, he would quote this passage of<lb/>
                    Scriptureâ€” "He that knoweth his master's will, and<lb/> doeth it not,
                    shall be beaten with many stripes."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Master would keep this lacerated young woman<lb/> tied up in this horrid
                    situation four or five hours at<lb/> a time. I have known him to tie her up
                    early in the<lb/> morning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her,<lb/> go to
                    his store, return at dinner, and whip her again,<lb/> cutting her in the places
                    already made raw with his<lb/> cruel lash. The secret of master's cruelty
                    toward<lb/> "Henny" is found in the fact of her being almost<lb/> helpless. When
                    quite a child, she fell into the fire,<lb/> and burned herself horribly. Her
                    hands were so<lb/> burnt that she never got the use of them. She could<lb/> do
                    very little but bear heavy burdens. She was to<lb/> master a bill of expense;
                    and as he was a mean man,<lb/> she was a constant offence to him. He seemed<lb/>
                    desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence.<lb/> He gave her away once
                    to his sister; but, being a<lb/> poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her.
                    Finally,<lb/> my benevolent master, to use his own words, "set<lb/> her adrift
                    to take care of herself." Here was a re-<lb/> cently-converted man, holding on
                    upon the mother,<lb/> and at the same time turning out her helpless child,<lb/>
                    to starve and die! Master Thomas was one of the<lb/> many pious slaveholders who
                    hold slaves for the<lb/> very charitable purpose of taking care of them.<lb/>
                    <pb n="58"/>
                </p>
                <p>My master and myself had quite a number of<lb/> differences. He found me
                    unsuitable to his purpose.<lb/> My city life, he said, had had a very pernicious
                    effect<lb/> upon me. It had almost ruined me for every good<lb/> purpose, and
                    fitted me for every thing which was<lb/> bad. One of my greatest faults was that
                    of letting<lb/> his horse run away, and go down to his father-in-<lb/> law's
                    farm, which was about five miles from St.<lb/> Michael's. I would then have to
                    go after it. My<lb/> reason for this kind of carelessness, or carefulness,<lb/>
                    was, that I could always get something to eat when<lb/> I went there. Master
                    William Hamilton, my master's<lb/> father-in-law, always gave his slaves enough
                    to eat.<lb/> I never left there hungry, no matter how great the<lb/> need of my
                    speedy return. Master Thomas at length<lb/> said he would stand it no longer. I
                    had lived with<lb/> him nine months, during which time he had given<lb/> me a
                    number of severe whippings, all to no good<lb/> purpose. He resolved to put me
                    out, as he said, to<lb/> be broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for
                    one<lb/> year to a man named Edward Covey. Mr. Covey<lb/> was a poor man, a
                    farm-renter. He rented the place<lb/> upon which he lived, as also the hands
                    with which<lb/> he tilled it. Mr. Covey had acquired a very high<lb/> reputation
                    for breaking young slaves, and this repu-<lb/> tation was of immense value to
                    him. It enabled him<lb/> to get his farm tilled with much less expense to<lb/>
                    himself than he could have had it done without<lb/> such a reputation. Some
                    slaveholders thought it not<lb/> much loss to allow Mr. Covey to have their
                    slaves<lb/> one year, for the sake of the training to which they<lb/> were
                    subjected, without any other compensation.<lb/> He could hire young help with
                    great ease, in con-<lb/> sequence of this reputation. Added to the natural<lb/>
                    good qualities of Mr. Covey, he was a professor of<lb/> religionâ€” a pious
                    soulâ€” a member and a class-leader in<lb/> the Methodist church. All of
                    this added weight to<lb/>
                    <pb n="59"/> his reputation as a "nigger-breaker." I was aware of<lb/> all the
                    facts, having been made acquainted with<lb/> them by a young man who had lived
                    there. I never-<lb/> theless made the change gladly; for I was sure of<lb/>
                    getting enough to eat, which is not the smallest<lb/> consideration to a hungry man.<lb/>

                <p>I had left Master Thomas's house, and went to live<lb/> with Mr. Covey, on the
                    1st of January, 1833. I was<lb/> now, for the first time in my life, a field
                    hand. In<lb/> my new employment, I found myself even more<lb/> awkward than a
                    country boy appeared to be in a<lb/> large city. I had been at my new home but
                    one<lb/> week before Mr. Covey gave me a very severe whip-<lb/> ping, cutting my
                    back, causing the blood to run,<lb/> and raising ridges on my flesh as large as
                    my little finger.<lb/> The details of this affair are as follows: Mr. Covey<lb/>
                    sent me, very early in the morning of one of our<lb/> coldest days in the month
                    of January, to the woods,<lb/> to get a load of wood. He gave me a team of
                    un-<lb/> broken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox,<lb/> and which the
                    off-hand one. He then tied the end<lb/> of a large rope around the horns of the
                    in-hand ox,<lb/> and gave me the other end of it, and told me, if<lb/> the oxen
                    started to run, that I must hold on upon<lb/> the rope. I had never driven oxen
                    before, and of<lb/> course I was very awkward. I, however, succeeded in<lb/>
                    getting to the edge of the woods with little diffi-<lb/> culty; but I had got a
                    very few rods into the woods,<lb/> when the oxen took fright, and started full
                    tilt, carry-<lb/> ing the cart against trees, and over stumps, in the<lb/> most
                    frightful manner. I expected every moment<lb/> that my brains would be dashed
                    out against the<lb/> trees. After running thus for a considerable dis-<lb/>
                    tance, they finally upset the cart, dashing it with<lb/> great force against a
                    tree, and threw themselves into<lb/> a dense thicket. How I escaped death, I do not<lb/>
                    <pb n="62"/> know. There I was, entirely alone, in a thick wood,<lb/> in a place
                    new to me. My cart was upset and shat-<lb/> tered, my oxen were entangled among
                    the young<lb/> trees, and there was none to help me. After a long<lb/> spell of
                    effort, I succeeded in getting my cart righted,<lb/> my oxen disentangled, and
                    again yoked to the cart.<lb/> I now proceeded with my team to the place
                    where<lb/> I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and<lb/> loaded my cart
                    pretty heavily, thinking in this way<lb/> to tame my oxen. I then proceeded on
                    my way<lb/> home. I had now consumed one half of the day. I<lb/> got out of the
                    woods safely, and now felt out of<lb/> danger. I stopped my oxen to open the
                    woods gate;<lb/> and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my<lb/>
                    ox-rope, the oxen again started, rushed through the<lb/> gate, catching it
                    between the wheel and the body of<lb/> the cart, tearing it to pieces, and
                    coming within a<lb/> few inches of crushing me against the gate-post. Thus<lb/>
                    twice, in one short day, I escaped death by the<lb/> merest chance. On my
                    return, I told Mr. Covey<lb/> what had happened, and how it happened. He
                    or-<lb/> dered me to return to the woods again immediately.<lb/> I did so, and
                    he followed on after me. Just as I got<lb/> into the woods, he came up and told
                    me to stop my<lb/> cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away<lb/> my
                    time, and break gates. He then went to a large<lb/> gum-tree, and with his axe
                    cut three large switches,<lb/> and, after trimming them up neatly with his
                    pocket-<lb/> knife, he ordered me to take off my clothes. I made<lb/> him no
                    answer, but stood with my clothes on. He<lb/> repeated his order. I still made
                    him no answer, nor<lb/> did I move to strip myself. Upon this he rushed<lb/> at
                    me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off my<lb/> clothes, and lashed me till
                    he had worn out his<lb/> switches, cutting me so savagely as to leave the
                    marks<lb/> visible for a long time after. This whipping was the<lb/>
                    <pb n="63"/> first of a number just like it, and for similar of-<lb/>
                    fences.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I lived with Mr. Covey one year. During the first<lb/> six months, of that year,
                    scarce a week passed with-<lb/> out his whipping me. I was seldom free from a
                    sore<lb/> back. My awkwardness was almost always his ex-<lb/> cuse for whipping
                    me. We were worked fully up<lb/> to the point of endurance. Long before day we
                    were<lb/> up, our horses fed, and by the first approach of day<lb/> we were off
                    to the field with our hoes and plough-<lb/> ing teams. Mr. Covey gave us enough
                    to eat, but<lb/> scarce time to eat it. We were often less than five<lb/>
                    minutes taking our meals. We were often in the field<lb/> from the first
                    approach of day till its last lingering<lb/> ray had left us; and at
                    saving-fodder time, midnight<lb/> often caught us in the field binding
                    blades.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Covey would be out with us. The way he used to<lb/> stand it, was this. He would
                    spend the most of his<lb/> afternoons in bed. He would then come out fresh<lb/>
                    in the evening, ready to urge us on with his words,<lb/> example, and frequently
                    with the whip. Mr. Covey<lb/> was one of the few slaveholders who could and
                    did<lb/> work with his hands. He was a hard-working man.<lb/> He knew by himself
                    just what a man or a boy could<lb/> do. There was no deceiving him. His work
                    went on<lb/> in his absence almost as well as in his presence; and<lb/> he had
                    the faculty of making us feel that he was<lb/> ever present with us. This he did
                    by surprising us.<lb/> He seldom approached the spot where we were at<lb/> work
                    openly, if he could do it secretly. He always<lb/> aimed at taking us by
                    surprise. Such was his cunning,<lb/> that we used to call him, among ourselves,
                    "the<lb/> snake." When we were at work in the cornfield, he<lb/> would sometimes
                    crawl on his hands and knees to<lb/> avoid detection, and all at once he would
                    rise<lb/> nearly in our midst, and scream out, "Ha, ha!<lb/> Come, come! Dash
                    on, dash on!" This being his<lb/>
                    <pb n="64"/> mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single<lb/> minute. His
                    comings were like a thief in the night.<lb/> He appeared to us as being ever at
                    hand. He was<lb/> under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush,<lb/> and
                    at every window, on the plantation. He would<lb/> sometimes mount his horse, as
                    if bound to St. Mi-<lb/> chael's, a distance of seven miles, and in half an<lb/>
                    hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in<lb/> the corner of the
                    wood-fence, watching every motion<lb/> of the slaves. He would, for this
                    purpose, leave his<lb/> horse tied up in the woods. Again, he would some-<lb/>
                    times walk up to us, and give us orders as though<lb/> he was upon the point of
                    starting on a long journey,<lb/> turn his back upon us, and make as though he
                    was<lb/> going to the house to get ready; and, before he would<lb/> get half way
                    thither, he would turn short and crawl<lb/> into a fence-corner, or behind some
                    tree, and there<lb/> watch us till the going down of the sun.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Covey's FORTE consisted in his power to de-<lb/> ceive. His life was devoted
                    to planning and perpe-<lb/> trating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he
                    pos-<lb/> sessed in the shape of learning or religion, he made<lb/> conform to
                    his disposition to deceive. He seemed<lb/> to think himself equal to deceiving
                    the Almighty.<lb/> He would make a short prayer in the morning, and<lb/> a long
                    prayer at night; and, strange as it may seem,<lb/> few men would at times appear
                    more devotional<lb/> than he. The exercises of his family devotions were<lb/>
                    always commenced with singing; and, as he was a<lb/> very poor singer himself,
                    the duty of raising the<lb/> hymn generally came upon me. He would read his<lb/>
                    hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at<lb/> times do so; at others, I would
                    not. My non-com-<lb/> pliance would almost always produce much confu-<lb/> sion.
                    To show himself independent of me, he would<lb/> start and stagger through with
                    his hymn in the most<lb/> discordant manner. In this state of mind, he prayed<lb/>
                    <pb n="65"/> with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man! such was<lb/> his
                    disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily<lb/> believe that he
                    sometimes deceived himself into the<lb/> solemn belief, that he was a sincere
                    worshipper of<lb/> the most high God; and this, too, at a time when<lb/> he may
                    be said to have been guilty of compelling<lb/> his woman slave to commit the sin
                    of adultery. The<lb/> facts in the case are these: Mr. Covey was a poor<lb/>
                    man; he was just commencing in life; he was only<lb/> able to buy one slave;
                    and, shocking as is the fact,<lb/> he bought her, as he said, for A BREEDER.
                    This woman<lb/> was named Caroline. Mr. Covey bought her from<lb/> Mr. Thomas
                    Lowe, about six miles from St. Mi-<lb/> chael's. She was a large, able-bodied
                    woman, about<lb/> twenty years old. She had already given birth to one<lb/>
                    child, which proved her to be just what he wanted.<lb/> After buying her, he
                    hired a married man of Mr.<lb/> Samuel Harrison, to live with him one year; and
                    him<lb/> he used to fasten up with her every night! The re-<lb/> sult was, that,
                    at the end of the year, the miserable<lb/> woman gave birth to twins. At this
                    result Mr. Covey<lb/> seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and<lb/>
                    the wretched woman. Such was his joy, and that of<lb/> his wife, that nothing
                    they could do for Caroline<lb/> during her confinement was too good, or too
                    hard,<lb/> to be done. The children were regarded as being<lb/> quite an
                    addition to his wealth.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>If at any one time of my life more than another,<lb/> I was made to drink the
                    bitterest dregs of slavery,<lb/> that time was during the first six months of my
                    stay<lb/> with Mr. Covey. We were worked in all weathers.<lb/> It was never too
                    hot or too cold; it could never rain,<lb/> blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us
                    to work in the<lb/> field. Work, work, work, was scarcely more the order<lb/> of
                    the day than of the night. The longest days were<lb/> too short for him, and the
                    shortest nights too long<lb/> for him. I was somewhat unmanageable when I first<lb/>
                    <pb n="66"/> went there, but a few months of this discipline<lb/> tamed me. Mr.
                    Covey succeeded in breaking me. I<lb/> was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My
                    natural<lb/> elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the<lb/>
                    disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that<lb/> lingered about my eye
                    died; the dark night of slavery<lb/> closed in upon me; and behold a man
                    transformed<lb/> into a brute!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Sunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in<lb/> a sort of beast-like
                    stupor, between sleep and wake,<lb/> under some large tree. At times I would
                    rise up, a<lb/> flash of energetic freedom would dart through my<lb/> soul,
                    accompanied with a faint beam of hope, that<lb/> flickered for a moment, and
                    then vanished. I sank<lb/> down again, mourning over my wretched condition.<lb/>
                    I was sometimes prompted to take my life, and that<lb/> of Covey, but was
                    prevented by a combination of<lb/> hope and fear. My sufferings on this
                    plantation seem<lb/> now like a dream rather than a stern reality.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesa-<lb/> peake Bay, whose broad bosom
                    was ever white with<lb/> sails from every quarter of the habitable globe.<lb/>
                    Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so<lb/> delightful to the eye of
                    freemen, were to me so<lb/> many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me<lb/>
                    with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have of-<lb/> ten, in the deep
                    stillness of a summer's Sabbath,<lb/> stood all alone upon the lofty banks of
                    that noble<lb/> bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful<lb/> eye, the
                    countless number of sails moving off to<lb/> the mighty ocean. The sight of
                    these always affected<lb/> me powerfully. My thoughts would compel utter-<lb/>
                    ance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty,<lb/> I would pour out my
                    soul's complaint, in my rude<lb/> way, with an apostrophe to the moving
                    multitude of<lb/> ships:â€”<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>"You are loosed from your morrings, and are free;<lb/>
                    <pb n="67"/> I am fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move<lb/> merrily
                    before the gentle gale, and I sadly before<lb/> the bloody whip! You are
                    freedom's swift-winged<lb/> angels, that fly round the world; I am confined
                    in<lb/> bands of iron! O that I were free! O, that I were<lb/> on one of your
                    gallant decks, and under your pro-<lb/> tecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you,
                    the turbid<lb/> waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go!<lb/> Could I
                    but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born<lb/> a man, of whom to make a brute!
                    The glad ship<lb/> is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in<lb/> the
                    hottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save<lb/> me! God, deliver me! Let me
                    be free! Is there any<lb/> God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will
                    not<lb/> stand it. Get caught, or get clear, I'll try it. I had<lb/> as well die
                    with ague as the fever. I have only one<lb/> life to lose. I had as well be
                    killed running as die<lb/> standing. Only think of it; one hundred miles<lb/>
                    straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God<lb/> helping me, I will. It
                    cannot be that I shall live<lb/> and die a slave. I will take to the water. This
                    very<lb/> bay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steam-<lb/> boats steered in a
                    north-east course from North<lb/> Point. I will do the same; and when I get to
                    the<lb/> head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and<lb/> walk straight
                    through Delaware into Pennsylvania.<lb/> When I get there, I shall not be
                    required to have a<lb/> pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but<lb/>
                    the first opportunity offer, and, come what will, I<lb/> am off. Meanwhile, I
                    will try to bear up under the<lb/> yoke. I am not the only slave in the world.
                    Why<lb/> should I fret? I can bear as much as any of them.<lb/> Besides, I am
                    but a boy, and all boys are bound to<lb/> some one. It may be that my misery in
                    slavery will<lb/> only increase my happiness when I get free. There<lb/> is a
                    better day coming."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Thus I used to think, and thus I used to speak<lb/>
                    <pb n="68"/> to myself; goaded almost to madness at one mo-<lb/> ment, and at
                    the next reconciling myself to my<lb/> wretched lot.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have already intimated that my condition was<lb/> much worse, during the first
                    six months of my stay<lb/> at Mr. Covey's, than in the last six. The
                    circum-<lb/> stances leading to the change in Mr. Covey's course<lb/> toward me
                    form an epoch in my humble history.<lb/> You have seen how a man was made a
                    slave; you<lb/> shall see how a slave was made a man. On one of<lb/> the hottest
                    days of the month of August, 1833, Bill<lb/> Smith, William Hughes, a slave
                    named Eli, and<lb/> myself, were engaged in fanning wheat. Hughes was<lb/>
                    clearing the fanned wheat from before the fan. Eli<lb/> was turning, Smith was
                    feeding, and I was carrying<lb/> wheat to the fan. The work was simple,
                    requiring<lb/> strength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely<lb/> unused
                    to such work, it came very hard. About three<lb/> o'clock of that day, I broke
                    down; my strength failed<lb/> me; I was seized with a violent aching of the
                    head,<lb/> attended with extreme dizziness; I trembled in every<lb/> limb.
                    Finding what was coming, I nerved myself<lb/> up, feeling it would never do to
                    stop work. I stood<lb/> as long as I could stagger to the hopper with
                    grain.<lb/> When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as<lb/> if held down
                    by an immense weight. The fan of<lb/> course stopped; every one had his own work
                    to do;<lb/> and no one could do the work of the other, and<lb/> have his own go
                    on at the same time.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred<lb/> yards from the treading-yard
                    where we were fanning.<lb/> On hearing the fan stop, he left immediately,
                    and<lb/> came to the spot where we were. He hastily in-<lb/> quired what the
                    matter was. Bill answered that I<lb/> was sick, and there was no one to bring
                    wheat to the<lb/> fan. I had by this time crawled away under the<lb/> side of
                    the post and rail-fence by which the yard<lb/>
                    <pb n="69"/> was enclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out<lb/> of the sun.
                    He then asked where I was. He was<lb/> told by one of the hands. He came to the
                    spot, and,<lb/> after looking at me awhile, asked me what was<lb/> the matter. I
                    told him as well as I could, for I scarce<lb/> had strength to speak. He then
                    gave me a savage<lb/> kick in the side, and told me to get up. I tried to<lb/>
                    do so, but fell back in the attempt. He gave me<lb/> another kick, and again
                    told me to rise. I again<lb/> tried, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but,
                    stoop-<lb/> ing to get the tub with which I was feeding the<lb/> fan, I again
                    staggered and fell. While down in this<lb/> situation, Mr. Covey took up the
                    hickory slat with<lb/> which Hughes had been striking off the half-bushel<lb/>
                    measure, and with it gave me a heavy blow upon<lb/> the head, making a large
                    wound, and the blood ran<lb/> freely; and with this again told me to get up. I
                    made<lb/> no effort to comply, having now made up my mind<lb/> to let him do his
                    worst. In a short time after re-<lb/> ceiving this blow, my head grew better.
                    Mr. Covey<lb/> had now left me to my fate. At this moment I re-<lb/> solved, for
                    the first time, to go to my master, enter<lb/> a complaint, and ask his
                    protection. In order to do<lb/> this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles;
                    and<lb/> this, under the circumstances, was truly a severe<lb/> undertaking. I
                    was exceedingly feeble; made so as<lb/> much by the kicks and blows which I
                    received, as<lb/> by the severe fit of sickness to which I had been<lb/>
                    subjected. I, however, watched my chance, while<lb/> Covey was looking in an
                    opposite direction, and<lb/> started for St. Michael's. I succeeded in getting
                    a<lb/> considerable distance on my way to the woods, when<lb/> Covey discovered
                    me, and called after me to come<lb/> back, threatening what he would do if I did
                    not<lb/> come. I disregarded both his calls and his threats,<lb/> and made my
                    way to the woods as fast as my feeble<lb/> state would allow; and thinking I
                    might be over-<lb/>
                    <pb n="70"/> hauled by him if I kept the road, I walked through<lb/> the woods,
                    keeping far enough from the road to<lb/> avoid detection, and near enough to
                    prevent losing<lb/> my way. I had not gone far before my little strength<lb/>
                    again failed me. I could go no farther. I fell down,<lb/> and lay for a
                    considerable time. The blood was yet<lb/> oozing from the wound on my head. For
                    a time I<lb/> thought I should bleed to death; and think now that<lb/> I should
                    have done so, but that the blood so matted<lb/> my hair as to stop the wound.
                    After lying there<lb/> about three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself<lb/> up
                    again, and started on my way, through bogs and<lb/> briers, barefooted and
                    bareheaded, tearing my feet<lb/> sometimes at nearly every step; and after a
                    journey<lb/> of about seven miles, occupying some five hours to<lb/> perform it,
                    I arrived at master's store. I then pre-<lb/> sented an appearance enough to
                    affect any but a<lb/> heart of iron. From the crown of my head to my<lb/> feet,
                    I was covered with blood. My hair was all<lb/> clotted with dust and blood; my
                    shirt was stiff with<lb/> blood. I suppose I looked like a man who had es-<lb/>
                    caped a den of wild beasts, and barely escaped them.<lb/> In this state I
                    appeared before my master, humbly<lb/> entreating him to interpose his authority
                    for my<lb/> protection. I told him all the circumstances as well<lb/> as I
                    could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to<lb/> affect him. He would then
                    walk the floor, and seek<lb/> to justify Covey by saying he expected I
                    deserved<lb/> it. He asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let<lb/> me get a
                    new home; that as sure as I lived with Mr.<lb/> Covey again, I should live with
                    but to die with<lb/> him; that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a<lb/> fair
                    way for it. Master Thomas ridiculed the idea<lb/> that there was any danger of
                    Mr. Covey's killing<lb/> me, and said that he knew Mr. Covey; that he was<lb/>
                    <pb n="71"/> a good man, and that he could not think of taking<lb/> me from him;
                    that, should he do so, he would lose<lb/> the whole year's wages; that I
                    belonged to Mr. Covey<lb/> for one year, and that I must go back to him,
                    come<lb/> what might; and that I must not trouble him with<lb/> any more
                    stories, or that he would himself GET HOLD<lb/> OF ME. After threatening me
                    thus, he gave me a very<lb/> large dose of salts, telling me that I might
                    remain<lb/> in St. Michael's that night, (it being quite late,)<lb/> but that I
                    must be off back to Mr. Covey's early<lb/> in the morning; and that if I did
                    not, he would<lb/> GET HOLD OF ME, which meant that he would whip<lb/> me. I
                    remained all night, and, according to his or-<lb/> ders, I started off to
                    Covey's in the morning, (Sat-<lb/> urday morning,) wearied in body and broken
                    in<lb/> spirit. I got no supper that night, or breakfast that<lb/> morning. I
                    reached Covey's about nine o'clock; and<lb/> just as I was getting over the
                    fence that divided<lb/> Mrs. Kemp's fields from ours, out ran Covey with<lb/>
                    his cowskin, to give me another whipping. Before<lb/> he could reach me, I
                    succeeded in getting to the<lb/> cornfield; and as the corn was very high, it
                    afforded<lb/> me the means of hiding. He seemed very angry, and<lb/> searched
                    for me a long time. My behavior was al-<lb/> together unaccountable. He finally
                    gave up the<lb/> chase, thinking, I suppose, that I must come home<lb/> for
                    something to eat; he would give himself no fur-<lb/> ther trouble in looking for
                    me. I spent that day<lb/> mostly in the woods, having the alternative
                    before<lb/> me,â€” to go home and be whipped to death, or stay<lb/> in the
                    woods and be starved to death. That night,<lb/> I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, a
                    slave with whom<lb/> I was somewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wife<lb/> who
                    lived about four miles from Mr. Covey's; and<lb/> it being Saturday, he was on
                    his way to see her. I<lb/> told him my circumstances, and he very kindly
                    in-<lb/> vited me to go home with him. I went home with<lb/>
                    <pb n="72"/> him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his<lb/> advice as
                    to what course it was best for me to pursue.<lb/> I found Sandy an old adviser.
                    He told me, with<lb/> great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that<lb/>
                    before I went, I must go with him into another<lb/> part of the woods, where
                    there was a certain ROOT,<lb/> which, if I would take some of it with me,
                    carrying<lb/> it ALWAYS ON MY RIGHT SIDE, would render it impos-<lb/> sible for
                    Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to<lb/> whip me. He said he had carried it
                    for years; and<lb/> since he had done so, he had never received a blow,<lb/> and
                    never expected to while he carried it. I at first<lb/> rejected the idea, that
                    the simple carrying of a root<lb/> in my pocket would have any such effect as he
                    had<lb/> said, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy<lb/> impressed the
                    necessity with much earnestness, tell-<lb/> ing me it could do no harm, if it
                    did no good. To<lb/> please him, I at length took the root, and, ac-<lb/>
                    cording to his direction, carried it upon my right<lb/> side. This was Sunday
                    morning. I immediately<lb/> started for home; and upon entering the yard
                    gate,<lb/> out came Mr. Covey on his way to meeting. He<lb/> spoke to me very
                    kindly, bade me drive the pigs<lb/> from a lot near by, and passed on towards
                    the<lb/> church. Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey<lb/> really made me
                    begin to think that there was some-<lb/> thing in the ROOT which Sandy had given
                    me; and<lb/> had it been on any other day than Sunday, I could<lb/> have
                    attributed the conduct to no other cause than<lb/> the influence of that root;
                    and as it was, I was half<lb/> inclined to think the ROOT to be something
                    more<lb/> than I at first had taken it to be. All went well till<lb/> Monday
                    morning. On this morning, the virtue of<lb/> the ROOT was fully tested. Long
                    before daylight, I<lb/> was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, the
                    horses.<lb/> I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But whilst thus<lb/> engaged,
                    whilst in the act of throwing down some<lb/> blades from the loft, Mr. Covey
                    entered the stable<lb/> with a long rope; and just as I was half out of the<lb/>
                    loft, he caught hold of my legs, and was about tying<lb/> me. As soon as I found
                    what he was up to, I gave<lb/> a sudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to
                    my<lb/> legs, I was brought sprawling on the stable floor.<lb/> Mr. Covey seemed
                    now to think he had me, and<lb/> could do what he pleased; but at this moment
                   â€”<lb/> from whence came the spirit I don't knowâ€” I re-<lb/> solved
                    to fight; and, suiting my action to the reso-<lb/> lution, I seized Covey hard
                    by the throat; and as I<lb/> did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him.
                    My<lb/> resistance was so entirely unexpected that Covey<lb/> seemed taken all
                    aback. He trembled like a leaf.<lb/> This gave me assurance, and I held him
                    uneasy,<lb/> causing the blood to run where I touched him with<lb/> the ends of
                    my fingers. Mr. Covey soon called out<lb/> to Hughes for help. Hughes came, and,
                    while Covey<lb/> held me, attempted to tie my right hand. While he<lb/> was in
                    the act of doing so, I watched my chance,<lb/> and gave him a heavy kick close
                    under the ribs.<lb/> This kick fairly sickened Hughes, so that he left<lb/> me
                    in the hands of Mr. Covey. This kick had the<lb/> effect of not only weakening
                    Hughes, but Covey also.<lb/> When he saw Hughes bending over with pain, his<lb/>
                    courage quailed. He asked me if I meant to persist<lb/> in my resistance. I told
                    him I did, come what<lb/> might; that he had used me like a brute for six<lb/>
                    months, and that I was determined to be used so<lb/> no longer. With that, he
                    strove to drag me to a<lb/> stick that was lying just out of the stable door.
                    He<lb/> meant to knock me down. But just as he was leaning<lb/> over to get the
                    stick, I seized him with both hands<lb/> by his collar, and brought him by a
                    sudden snatch<lb/> to the ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called<lb/>
                    upon him for assistance. Bill wanted to know what<lb/> he could do. Covey said,
                    "Take hold of him, take<lb/>
                    <pb n="74"/> hold of him!" Bill said his master hired him out to<lb/> work, and
                    not to help to whip me; so he left Covey<lb/> and myself to fight our own battle
                    out. We were<lb/> at it for nearly two hours. Covey at length let me<lb/> go,
                    puffing and blowing at a great rate, saying that<lb/> if I had not resisted, he
                    would not have whipped<lb/> me half so much. The truth was, that he had not<lb/>
                    whipped me at all. I considered him as getting en-<lb/> tirely the worst end of
                    the bargain; for he had drawn<lb/> no blood from me, but I had from him. The
                    whole<lb/> six months afterwards, that I spent with Mr. Covey,<lb/> he never
                    laid the weight of his finger upon me in<lb/> anger. He would occasionally say,
                    he didn't want<lb/> to get hold of me again. "No," thought I, "you<lb/> need
                    not; for you will come off worse than you did<lb/> before."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-<lb/> point in my career as a slave.
                    It rekindled the few<lb/> expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me<lb/>
                    a sense of my own manhood. It recalled the de-<lb/> parted self-confidence, and
                    inspired me again with<lb/> a determination to be free. The gratification
                    af-<lb/> forded by the triumph was a full compensation for<lb/> whatever else
                    might follow, even death itself. He<lb/> only can understand the deep
                    satisfaction which I<lb/> experienced, who has himself repelled by force
                    the<lb/> bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before.<lb/> It was a
                    glorious resurrection, from the tomb of<lb/> slavery, to the heaven of freedom.
                    My long-crushed<lb/> spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took<lb/>
                    its place; and I now resolved that, however long I<lb/> might remain a slave in
                    form, the day had passed<lb/> forever when I could be a slave in fact. I did
                    not<lb/> hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white<lb/> man who expected
                    to succeed in whipping, must<lb/> also succeed in killing me.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>From this time I was never again what might be<lb/>
                    <pb n="75"/> called fairly whipped, though I remained a slave<lb/> four years
                    afterwards. I had several fights, but was<lb/> never whipped.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me<lb/> why Mr. Covey did not
                    immediately have me taken<lb/> by the constable to the whipping-post, and
                    there<lb/> regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand<lb/> against a
                    white man in defence of myself. And the<lb/> only explanation I can now think of
                    does not entirely<lb/> satisfy me; but such as it is, I will give it. Mr.
                    Covey<lb/> enjoyed the most unbounded reputation for being<lb/> a first-rate
                    overseer and negro-breaker. It was of con-<lb/> siderable importance to him.
                    That reputation was at<lb/> stake; and had he sent meâ€” a boy about
                    sixteen years<lb/> oldâ€” to the public whipping-post, his reputation<lb/>
                    would have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he<lb/> suffered me to go
                    unpunished.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey<lb/> ended on Christmas day, 1833.
                    The days between<lb/> Christmas and New Year's day are allowed as holi-<lb/>
                    days; and, accordingly, we were not required to per-<lb/> form any labor, more
                    than to feed and take care of<lb/> the stock. This time we regarded as our own,
                    by the<lb/> grace of our masters; and we therefore used or<lb/> abused it nearly
                    as we pleased. Those of us who had<lb/> families at a distance, were generally
                    allowed to<lb/> spend the whole six days in their society. This time,<lb/>
                    however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober,<lb/> thinking and
                    industrious ones of our number would<lb/> employ themselves in making
                    corn-brooms, mats,<lb/> horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us<lb/>
                    would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares,<lb/> and coons. But by far the
                    larger part engaged in<lb/> such sports and merriments as playing ball,
                    wres-<lb/> tling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and<lb/> drinking
                    whisky; and this latter mode of spending<lb/> the time was by far the most
                    agreeable to the feel-<lb/>
                    <pb n="76"/> ings of our masters. A slave who would work during<lb/> the
                    holidays was considered by our masters as<lb/> scarcely deserving them. He was
                    regarded as one<lb/> who rejected the favor of his master. It was deemed<lb/> a
                    disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he<lb/> was regarded as lazy indeed,
                    who had not provided<lb/> himself with the necessary means, during the
                    year,<lb/> to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>From what I know of the effect of these holidays<lb/> upon the slave, I believe
                    them to be among the<lb/> most effective means in the hands of the
                    slaveholder<lb/> in keeping down the spirit of insurrection. Were<lb/> the
                    slaveholders at once to abandon this practice,<lb/> I have not the slightest
                    doubt it would lead to an<lb/> immediate insurrection among the slaves.
                    These<lb/> holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry<lb/> off the
                    rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. But<lb/> for these, the slave would be
                    forced up to the wild-<lb/> est desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder,
                    the<lb/> day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation<lb/> of those
                    conductors! I warn him that, in such an<lb/> event, a spirit will go forth in
                    their midst, more to<lb/> be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The holidays are part and parcel of the gross<lb/> fraud, wrong, and inhumanity
                    of slavery. They are<lb/> professedly a custom established by the
                    benevolence<lb/> of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the<lb/>
                    result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds<lb/> committed upon the
                    down-trodden slave. They do<lb/> not give the slaves this time because they
                    would<lb/> not like to have their work during its continuance,<lb/> but because
                    they know it would be unsafe to deprive<lb/> them of it. This will be seen by
                    the fact, that the<lb/> slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those<lb/>
                    days just in such a manner as to make them as glad<lb/> of their ending as of
                    their beginning. Their object<lb/> seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom,<lb/>
                    <pb n="77"/> by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipa-<lb/> tion. For
                    instance, the slaveholders not only like to<lb/> see the slave drink of his own
                    accord, but will adopt<lb/> various plans to make him drunk. One plan is,
                    to<lb/> make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the<lb/> most whisky
                    without getting drunk; and in this way<lb/> they succeed in getting whole
                    multitudes to drink<lb/> to excess. Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous<lb/>
                    freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ig-<lb/> norance, cheats him with
                    a dose of vicious dissi-<lb/> pation, artfully labelled with the name of
                    liberty.<lb/> The most of us used to drink it down, and the result<lb/> was just
                    what might be supposed; many of us<lb/> were led to think that there was little
                    to choose<lb/> between liberty and slavery. We felt, and very prop-<lb/> erly
                    too, that we had almost as well be slaves to<lb/> man as to rum. So, when the
                    holidays ended, we<lb/> staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took<lb/>
                    a long breath, and marched to the field,â€” feeling,<lb/> upon the whole,
                    rather glad to go, from what our<lb/> master had deceived us into a belief was
                    freedom,<lb/> back to the arms of slavery.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have said that this mode of treatment is a part<lb/> of the whole system of
                    fraud and inhumanity of<lb/> slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to
                    disgust<lb/> the slave with freedom, by allowing him to see only<lb/> the abuse
                    of it, is carried out in other things. For<lb/> instance, a slave loves
                    molasses; he steals some.<lb/> His master, in many cases, goes off to town,
                    and<lb/> buys a large quantity; he returns, takes his whip,<lb/> and commands
                    the slave to eat the molasses, until<lb/> the poor fellow is made sick at the
                    very mention<lb/> of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to make<lb/> the
                    slaves refrain from asking for more food than<lb/> their regular allowance. A
                    slave runs through his<lb/> allowance, and applies for more. His master is
                    en-<lb/> raged at him; but, not willing to send him off with-<lb/>
                    <pb n="78"/> out food, gives him more than is necessary, and com-<lb/> pels him
                    to eat it within a given time. Then, if he<lb/> complains that he cannot eat it,
                    he is said to be<lb/> satisfied neither full nor fasting, and is whipped<lb/>
                    for being hard to please! I have an abundance of<lb/> such illustrations of the
                    same principle, drawn from<lb/> my own observation, but think the cases I have
                    cited<lb/> sufficient. The practice is a very common one.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>On the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey,<lb/> and went to live with Mr.
                    William Freeland, who<lb/> lived about three miles from St. Michael's. I
                    soon<lb/> found Mr. Freeland a very different man from Mr.<lb/> Covey. Though
                    not rich, he was what would be<lb/> called an educated southern gentleman. Mr.
                    Covey,<lb/> as I have shown, was a well-trained negro-breaker<lb/> and
                    slave-driver. The former (slaveholder though he<lb/> was) seemed to possess some
                    regard for honor,<lb/> some reverence for justice, and some respect for<lb/>
                    humanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to<lb/> all such sentiments. Mr.
                    Freeland had many of the<lb/> faults peculiar to slaveholders, such as being
                    very<lb/> passionate and fretful; but I must do him the<lb/> justice to say,
                    that he was exceedingly free from<lb/> those degrading vices to which Mr. Covey
                    was con-<lb/> stantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and<lb/> we always
                    knew where to find him. The other was a<lb/> most artful deceiver, and could be
                    understood only<lb/> by such as were skilful enough to detect his cun-<lb/>
                    ningly-devised frauds. Another advantage I gained<lb/> in my new master was, he
                    made no pretensions to,<lb/> or profession of, religion; and this, in my
                    opinion,<lb/> was truly a great advantage. I assert most unhesi-<lb/> tatingly,
                    that the religion of the south is a mere<lb/> covering for the most horrid
                    crimes,â€” a justifier of<lb/> the most appalling barbarity,â€” a
                    sanctifier of the<lb/> most hateful frauds,â€” and a dark shelter
                    under,<lb/> which the darkest, foulest, grossest, and most infer-<lb/>
                    <pb n="79"/> nal deeds of slaveholders find the strongest protec-<lb/> tion.
                    Were I to be again reduced to the chains of<lb/> slavery, next to that
                    enslavement, I should regard<lb/> being the slave of a religious master the
                    greatest<lb/> calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders<lb/> with
                    whom I have ever met, religious slaveholders<lb/> are the worst. I have ever
                    found them the meanest<lb/> and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all
                    oth-<lb/> ers. It was my unhappy lot not only to belong to a<lb/> religious
                    slaveholder, but to live in a community of<lb/> such religionists. Very near Mr.
                    Freeland lived the<lb/> Rev. Daniel Weeden, and in the same neighborhood<lb/>
                    lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These were members<lb/> and ministers in the
                    Reformed Methodist Church.<lb/> Mr. Weeden owned, among others, a woman
                    slave,<lb/> whose name I have forgotten. This woman's back,<lb/> for weeks, was
                    kept literally raw, made so by the<lb/> lash of this merciless, RELIGIOUS
                    wretch. He used to<lb/> hire hands. His maxim was, Behave well or behave<lb/>
                    ill, it is the duty of a master occasionally to whip<lb/> a slave, to remind him
                    of his master's authority.<lb/> Such was his theory, and such his practice.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden.<lb/> His chief boast was his ability
                    to manage slaves.<lb/> The peculiar feature of his government was that<lb/> of
                    whipping slaves in advance of deserving it. He<lb/> always managed to have one
                    or more of his slaves<lb/> to whip every Monday morning. He did this to
                    alarm<lb/> their fears, and strike terror into those who escaped.<lb/> His plan
                    was to whip for the smallest offences, to<lb/> prevent the commission of large
                    ones. Mr. Hopkins<lb/> could always find some excuse for whipping a slave.<lb/>
                    It would astonish one, unaccustomed to a slave-<lb/> holding life, to see with
                    what wonderful ease a slave-<lb/> holder can find things, of which to make
                    occasion<lb/> to whip a slave. A mere look, word, or motion,â€” a<lb/>
                    mistake, accident, or want of power,â€” are all matters<lb/>
                    <pb n="80"/> for which a slave may be whipped at any time. Does<lb/> a slave
                    look dissatisfied? It is said, he has the devil<lb/> in him, and it must be
                    whipped out. Does he speak<lb/> loudly when spoken to by his master? Then he
                    is<lb/> getting high-minded, and should be taken down a<lb/> button-hole lower.
                    Does he forget to pull off his<lb/> hat at the approach of a white person? Then
                    he is<lb/> wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for<lb/> it. Does he ever
                    venture to vindicate his conduct,<lb/> when censured for it? Then he is guilty
                    of impu-<lb/> dence,â€” one of the greatest crimes of which a slave<lb/>
                    can be guilty. Does he ever venture to suggest a<lb/> different mode of doing
                    things from that pointed<lb/> out by his master? He is indeed presumptuous,
                    and<lb/> getting above himself; and nothing less than a flog-<lb/> ging will do
                    for him. Does he, while ploughing,<lb/> break a plough,â€” or, while
                    hoeing, break a hoe? It<lb/> is owing to his carelessness, and for it a slave
                    must<lb/> always be whipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find<lb/> something of
                    this sort to justify the use of the lash,<lb/> and he seldom failed to embrace
                    such opportunities.<lb/> There was not a man in the whole county, with<lb/> whom
                    the slaves who had the getting their own<lb/> home, would not prefer to live,
                    rather than with<lb/> this Rev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a<lb/> man
                    any where round, who made higher professions<lb/> of religion, or was more
                    active in revivals,â€” more<lb/> attentive to the class, love-feast, prayer
                    and preach-<lb/> ing meetings, or more devotional in his family,â€”<lb/>
                    that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,â€” than<lb/> this same
                    reverend slave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>But to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experi-<lb/> ence while in his
                    employment. He, like Mr. Covey,<lb/> gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr.
                    Covey, he<lb/> also gave us sufficient time to take our meals. He<lb/> worked us
                    hard, but always between sunrise and<lb/> sunset. He required a good deal of
                    work to be done,<lb/>
                    <pb n="81"/> but gave us good tools with which to work. His<lb/> farm was large,
                    but he employed hands enough to<lb/> work it, and with ease, compared with many
                    of<lb/> his neighbors. My treatment, while in his employ-<lb/> ment, was
                    heavenly, compared with what I experi-<lb/> enced at the hands of Mr. Edward
                    Covey.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Freeland was himself the owner of but two<lb/> slaves. Their names were Henry
                    Harris and John<lb/> Harris. The rest of his hands he hired. These con-<lb/>
                    sisted of myself, Sandy Jenkins,* and Handy Cald-<lb/> well. Henry and John were
                    quite intelligent, and in<lb/> a very little while after I went there, I
                    succeeded in<lb/> creating in them a strong desire to learn how to<lb/> read.
                    This desire soon sprang up in the others also.<lb/> They very soon mustered up
                    some old spelling-books,<lb/> and nothing would do but that I must keep a
                    Sab-<lb/> bath school. I agreed to do so, and accordingly<lb/> devoted my
                    Sundays to teaching these my loved fel-<lb/> low-slaves how to read. Neither of
                    them knew his<lb/> letters when I went there. Some of the slaves of the<lb/>
                    neighboring farms found what was going on, and<lb/> also availed themselves of
                    this little opportunity to<lb/> learn to read. It was understood, among all
                    who<lb/> came, that there must be as little display about it<lb/> as possible.
                    It was necessary to keep our religious<lb/> masters at St. Michael's
                    unacquainted with the fact,<lb/> that, instead of spending the Sabbath in
                    wrestling,<lb/> boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn<lb/> how to
                    read the will of God; for they had much<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>*This is the same man who gave me the roots to prevent<lb/> my being whipped by
                    Mr. Covey. He was "a clever soul."<lb/> We used frequently to talk about the
                    fight with Covey, and<lb/> as often as we did so, he would claim my success as
                    the<lb/> result of the roots which he gave me. This superstition<lb/> is very
                    common among the more ignorant slaves. A slave<lb/> seldom dies but that his
                    death is attributed to trickery.<lb/>
                    <pb n="82"/> rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than<lb/> to see
                    us behaving like intellectual, moral, and ac-<lb/> countable beings. My blood
                    boils as I think of the<lb/> bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright
                    Fairbanks<lb/> and Garrison West, both class-leaders, in connection<lb/> with
                    many others, rushed in upon us with sticks<lb/> and stones, and broke up our
                    virtuous little Sab-<lb/> bath school, at St. Michael'sâ€” all calling
                    themselves<lb/> Christians! humble followers of the Lord Jesus<lb/> Christ! But
                    I am again digressing.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free<lb/> colored man, whose name I
                    deem it imprudent to<lb/> mention; for should it be known, it might embar-<lb/>
                    rass him greatly, though the crime of holding the<lb/> school was committed ten
                    years ago. I had at one<lb/> time over forty scholars, and those of the right
                    sort,<lb/> ardently desiring to learn. They were of all ages,<lb/> though mostly
                    men and women. I look back to those<lb/> Sundays with an amount of pleasure not
                    to be ex-<lb/> pressed. They were great days to my soul. The work<lb/> of
                    instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetest<lb/> engagement with which I
                    was ever blessed. We loved<lb/> each other, and to leave them at the close of
                    the<lb/> Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. When I think<lb/> that these
                    precious souls are to-day shut up in the<lb/> prison-house of slavery, my
                    feelings overcome me,<lb/> and I am almost ready to ask, "Does a righteous<lb/>
                    God govern the universe? and for what does he hold<lb/> the thunders in his
                    right hand, if not to smite the<lb/> oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of
                    the hand<lb/> of the spoiler?" These dear souls came not to Sab-<lb/> bath
                    school because it was popular to do so, nor did<lb/> I teach them because it was
                    reputable to be thus<lb/> engaged. Every moment they spent in that school,<lb/>
                    they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-<lb/> nine lashes. They came
                    because they wished to<lb/> learn. Their minds had been starved by their cruel<lb/>
                    <pb n="83"/> masters. They had been shut up in mental darkness.<lb/> I taught
                    them, because it was the delight of my<lb/> soul to be doing something that
                    looked like better-<lb/> ing the condition of my race. I kept up my school<lb/>
                    nearly the whole year I lived with Mr. Freeland;<lb/> and, beside my Sabbath
                    school, I devoted three eve-<lb/> nings in the week, during the winter, to
                    teaching the<lb/> slaves at home. And I have the happiness to know,<lb/> that
                    several of those who came to Sabbath school<lb/> learned how to read; and that
                    one, at least, is now<lb/> free through my agency.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The year passed off smoothly. It seemed only<lb/> about half as long as the year
                    which preceded it.<lb/> I went through it without receiving a single blow.<lb/>
                    I will give Mr. Freeland the credit of being the<lb/> best master I ever had,
                    TILL I BECAME MY OWN MAS-<lb/> TER. For the ease with which I passed the year,
                    I<lb/> was, however, somewhat indebted to the society of<lb/> my fellow-slaves.
                    They were noble souls; they not<lb/> only possessed loving hearts, but brave
                    ones. We<lb/> were linked and interlinked with each other. I loved<lb/> them
                    with a love stronger than any thing I have<lb/> experienced since. It is
                    sometimes said that we<lb/> slaves do not love and confide in each other.
                    In<lb/> answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved<lb/> any or confided
                    in any people more than my fellow-<lb/> slaves, and especially those with whom I
                    lived at<lb/> Mr. Freeland's. I believe we would have died for<lb/> each other.
                    We never undertook to do any thing,<lb/> of any importance, without a mutual
                    consultation.<lb/> We never moved separately. We were one; and as<lb/> much so
                    by our tempers and dispositions, as by the<lb/> mutual hardships to which we
                    were necessarily sub-<lb/> jected by our condition as slaves.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>At the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again<lb/> hired me of my master, for
                    the year 1835. But, by<lb/> this time, I began to want to live UPON FREE LAND<lb/>
                    <pb n="84"/> as well as WITH FREELAND; and I was no longer con-<lb/> tent,
                    therefore, to live with him or any other slave-<lb/> holder. I began, with the
                    commencement of the<lb/> year, to prepare myself for a final struggle,
                    which<lb/> should decide my fate one way or the other. My<lb/> tendency was
                    upward. I was fast approaching man-<lb/> hood, and year after year had passed,
                    and I was<lb/> still a slave. These thoughts roused meâ€” I must do<lb/>
                    something. I therefore resolved that 1835 should<lb/> not pass without
                    witnessing an attempt, on my part,<lb/> to secure my liberty. But I was not
                    willing to cherish<lb/> this determination alone. My fellow-slaves were
                    dear<lb/> to me. I was anxious to have them participate with<lb/> me in this, my
                    life-giving determination. I therefore,<lb/> though with great prudence,
                    commenced early to<lb/> ascertain their views and feelings in regard to
                    their<lb/> condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts<lb/> of freedom. I
                    bent myself to devising ways and<lb/> means for our escape, and meanwhile
                    strove, on all<lb/> fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross<lb/> fraud
                    and inhumanity of slavery. I went first to<lb/> Henry, next to John, then to the
                    others. I found,<lb/> in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They<lb/> were
                    ready to hear, and ready to act when a feasible<lb/> plan should be proposed.
                    This was what I wanted.<lb/> I talked to them of our want of manhood, if we<lb/>
                    submitted to our enslavement without at least one<lb/> noble effort to be free.
                    We met often, and consulted<lb/> frequently, and told our hopes and fears,
                    recounted<lb/> the difficulties, real and imagined, which we should<lb/> be
                    called on to meet. At times were were almost dis-<lb/> posed to give up, and try
                    to content ourselves with<lb/> our wretched lot; at others, we were firm and
                    un-<lb/> bending in our determination to go. Whenever we<lb/> suggested any
                    plan, there was shrinkingâ€” the odds<lb/> were fearful. Our path was beset
                    with the greatest<lb/> obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end<lb/>
                    <pb n="85"/> of it, our right to be free was yet questionableâ€” we<lb/>
                    were yet liable to be returned to bondage. We could<lb/> see no spot, this side
                    of the ocean, where we could<lb/> be free. We knew nothing about Canada.
                    Our<lb/> knowledge of the north did not extend farther than<lb/> New York; and
                    to go there, and be forever harassed<lb/> with the frightful liability of being
                    returned to<lb/> slaveryâ€” with the certainty of being treated
                    tenfold<lb/> worse than beforeâ€” the thought was truly a horrible<lb/>
                    one, and one which it was not easy to overcome.<lb/> The case sometimes stood
                    thus: At every gate<lb/> through which we were to pass, we saw a watchman<lb/>
                   â€” at every ferry a guardâ€” on every bridge a sentinelâ€”<lb/>
                    and in every wood a patrol. We were hemmed in<lb/> upon every side. Here were
                    the difficulties, real or<lb/> imaginedâ€” the good to be sought, and the
                    evil to be<lb/> shunned. On the one hand, there stood slavery, a<lb/> stern
                    reality, glaring frightfully upon us,â€” its robes<lb/> already crimsoned
                    with the blood of millions, and<lb/> even now feasting itself greedily upon our
                    own flesh.<lb/> On the other hand, away back in the dim distance,<lb/> under the
                    flickering light of the north star, behind<lb/> some craggy hill or snow-covered
                    mountain, stood<lb/> a doubtful freedomâ€” half frozenâ€” beckoning us
                    to<lb/> come and share its hospitality. This in itself was<lb/> sometimes enough
                    to stagger us; but when we per-<lb/> mitted ourselves to survey the road, we
                    were fre-<lb/> quently appalled. Upon either side we saw grim<lb/> death,
                    assuming the most horrid shapes. Now it was<lb/> starvation, causing us to eat
                    our own flesh;â€” now we<lb/> were contending with the waves, and were
                    drowned;<lb/>â€” now we were overtaken, and torn to pieces by the<lb/>
                    fangs of the terrible bloodhound. We were stung<lb/> by scorpions, chased by
                    wild beasts, bitten by snakes,<lb/> and finally, after having nearly reached the
                    desired<lb/> spot,â€” after swimming rivers, encountering wild<lb/> beasts,
                    sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and<lb/>
                    <pb n="86"/> nakedness,â€” we were overtaken by our pursuers, and,<lb/> in
                    our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot!<lb/> I say, this picture
                    sometimes appalled us, and made<lb/> us<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p> "rather bear those ills we had,<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> Than fly to others, that we knew not of."<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In coming to a fixed determination to run away,<lb/> we did more than Patrick
                    Henry, when he resolved<lb/> upon liberty or death. With us it was a
                    doubtful<lb/> liberty at most, and almost certain death if we failed.<lb/> For
                    my part, I should prefer death to hopeless bond-<lb/> age.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Sandy, one of our number, gave up the notion,<lb/> but still encouraged us. Our
                    company then consisted<lb/> of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey,
                    Charles<lb/> Roberts, and myself. Henry Bailey was my uncle,<lb/> and belonged
                    to my master. Charles married my<lb/> aunt: he belonged to my master's
                    father-in-law, Mr.<lb/> William Hamilton.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The plan we finally concluded upon was, to get<lb/> a large canoe belonging to
                    Mr. Hamilton, and upon<lb/> the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays,<lb/>
                    paddle directly up the Chesapeake Bay. On our ar-<lb/> rival at the head of the
                    bay, a distance of seventy<lb/> or eighty miles from where we lived, it was
                    our<lb/> purpose to turn our canoe adrift, and follow the<lb/> guidance of the
                    north star till we got beyond the<lb/> limits of Maryland. Our reason for taking
                    the water<lb/> route was, that we were less liable to be suspected as<lb/>
                    runaways; we hoped to be regarded as fishermen;<lb/> whereas, if we should take
                    the land route, we should<lb/> be subjected to interruptions of almost every
                    kind.<lb/> Any one having a white face, and being so disposed,<lb/> could stop
                    us, and subject us to examination.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The week before our intended start, I wrote sev-<lb/>
                    <pb n="87"/> eral protections, one for each of us. As well as I<lb/> can
                    remember, they were in the following words, to<lb/> wit:â€”<lb/>
                    <lb/>

                <p>"This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have<lb/> given the bearer, my
                    servant, full liberty to go to<lb/> Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.
                    Written<lb/> with mine own hand, &amp;c., 1835.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p> "WILLIAM HAMILTON, <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>"Near St. Michael's, in Talbot county, Maryland."<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up<lb/> the bay, we went toward
                    Baltimore, and these pro-<lb/> tections were only intended to protect us while
                    on<lb/> the bay.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>As the time drew near for our departure, our<lb/> anxiety became more and more
                    intense. It was truly<lb/> a matter of life and death with us. The strength
                    of<lb/> our determination was about to be fully tested. At<lb/> this time, I was
                    very active in explaining every dif-<lb/> ficulty, removing every doubt,
                    dispelling every fear,<lb/> and inspiring all with the firmness indispensable
                    to<lb/> success in our undertaking; assuring them that half<lb/> was gained the
                    instant we made the move; we had<lb/> talked long enough; we were now ready to
                    move;<lb/> if not now, we never should be; and if we did not<lb/> intend to move
                    now, we had as well fold our arms,<lb/> sit down, and acknowledge ourselves fit
                    only to be<lb/> slaves. This, none of us were prepared to acknowl-<lb/> edge.
                    Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting,<lb/> we pledged ourselves afresh,
                    in the most solemn<lb/> manner, that, at the time appointed, we would cer-<lb/>
                    tainly start in pursuit of freedom. This was in the<lb/> middle of the week, at
                    the end of which we were<lb/> to be off. We went, as usual, to our several
                    fields<lb/> of labor, but with bosoms highly agitated with<lb/> thoughts of our
                    truly hazardous undertaking. We<lb/>
                    <pb n="88"/> tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible;<lb/> and I think
                    we succeeded very well.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>After a painful waiting, the Saturday morning,<lb/> whose night was to witness
                    our departure, came. I<lb/> hailed it with joy, bring what of sadness it
                    might.<lb/> Friday night was a sleepless one for me. I probably<lb/> felt more
                    anxious than the rest, because I was, by<lb/> common consent, at the head of the
                    whole affair.<lb/> The responsibility of success or failure lay heavily<lb/>
                    upon me. The glory of the one, and the confusion<lb/> of the other, were alike
                    mine. The first two hours<lb/> of that morning were such as I never
                    experienced<lb/> before, and hope never to again. Early in the<lb/> morning, we
                    went, as usual, to the field. We were<lb/> spreading manure; and all at once,
                    while thus en-<lb/> gaged, I was overwhelmed with an indescribable feel-<lb/>
                    ing, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who<lb/> was near by, and said,
                    "We are betrayed!" "Well,"<lb/> said he, "that thought has this moment struck
                    me."<lb/> We said no more. I was never more certain of any<lb/> thing.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The horn was blown as usual, and we went up<lb/> from the field to the house for
                    breakfast. I went for<lb/> the form, more than for want of any thing to eat<lb/>
                    that morning. Just as I got to the house, in looking<lb/> out at the lane gate,
                    I saw four white men, with<lb/> two colored men. The white men were on
                    horseback,<lb/> and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied.<lb/> I
                    watched them a few moments till they got up to<lb/> our lane gate. Here they
                    halted, and tied the colored<lb/> men to the gate-post. I was not yet certain as
                    to<lb/> what the matter was. In a few moments, in rode<lb/> Mr. Hamilton, with a
                    speed betokening great excite-<lb/> ment. He came to the door, and inquired if
                    Master<lb/> William was in. He was told he was at the barn. Mr.<lb/> Hamilton,
                    without dismounting, rode up to the barn<lb/> with extraordinary speed. In a few
                    moments, he and<lb/>
                    <pb n="89"/> Mr. Freeland returned to the house. By this time,<lb/> the three
                    constables rode up, and in great haste dis-<lb/> mounted, tied their horses, and
                    met Master William<lb/> and Mr. Hamilton returning from the barn; and<lb/> after
                    talking awhile, they all walked up to the<lb/> kitchen door. There was no one in
                    the kitchen but<lb/> myself and John. Henry and Sandy were up at the<lb/> barn.
                    Mr. Freeland put his head in at the door, and<lb/> called me by name, saying,
                    there were some gentle-<lb/> men at the door who wished to see me. I
                    stepped<lb/> to the door, and inquired what they wanted. They<lb/> at once
                    seized me, and, without giving me any satis-<lb/> faction, tied meâ€”
                    lashing my hands closely together.<lb/> I insisted upon knowing what the matter
                    was. They<lb/> at length said, that they had learned I had been in a<lb/>
                    "scrape," and that I was to be examined before my<lb/> master; and if their
                    information proved false, I<lb/> should not be hurt.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In a few moments, they succeeded in tying John.<lb/> They then turned to Henry,
                    who had by this time<lb/> returned, and commanded him to cross his hands.<lb/>
                    "I won't!" said Henry, in a firm tone, indicating his<lb/> readiness to meet the
                    consequences of his refusal.<lb/> "Won't you?" said Tom Graham, the constable.
                    "No,<lb/> I won't!" said Henry, in a still stronger tone. With<lb/> this, two of
                    the constables pulled out their shining<lb/> pistols, and swore, by their
                    Creator, that they would<lb/> make him cross his hands or kill him. Each
                    cocked<lb/> his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger, walked<lb/> up to
                    Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not<lb/> cross his hands, they would
                    blow his damned heart<lb/> out. "Shoot me, shoot me!" said Henry; "you
                    can't<lb/> kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,â€” and be damned! I<lb/> WON'T
                    BE TIED!" This he said in a tone of loud defi-<lb/> ance; and at the same time,
                    with a motion as quick<lb/> as lightning, he with one single stroke dashed
                    the<lb/> pistols from the hand of each constable. As he did<lb/>
                    <pb n="90"/> this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating<lb/> him some
                    time, they finally overpowered him, and<lb/> got him tied.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>During the scuffle, I managed, I know not how,<lb/> to get my pass out, and,
                    without being discovered,<lb/> put it into the fire. We were all now tied; and
                    just<lb/> as we were to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland,<lb/> mother of
                    William Freeland, came to the door with<lb/> her hands full of biscuits, and
                    divided them between<lb/> Henry and John. She then delivered herself of a<lb/>
                    speech, to the following effect:â€” addressing herself<lb/> to me, she
                    said, "YOU DEVIL! YOU YELLOW DEVIL! it was<lb/> you that put it into the heads
                    of Henry and John<lb/> to run away. But for you, you long-legged mulatto<lb/>
                    devil! Henry nor John would never have thought<lb/> of such a thing." I made no
                    reply, and was imme-<lb/> diately hurried off towards St. Michael's. Just a
                    mo-<lb/> ment previous to the scuffle with Henry, Mr. Hamil-<lb/> ton suggested
                    the propriety of making a search for<lb/> the protections which he had
                    understood Frederick<lb/> had written for himself and the rest. But, just
                    at<lb/> the moment he was about carrying his proposal into<lb/> effect, his aid
                    was needed in helping to tie Henry;<lb/> and the excitement attending the
                    scuffle caused<lb/> them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under<lb/> the
                    circumstances, to search. So we were not yet<lb/> convicted of the intention to
                    run away.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>When we got about half way to St. Michael's,<lb/> while the constables having us
                    in charge were look-<lb/> ing ahead, Henry inquired of me what he should<lb/> do
                    with his pass. I told him to eat it with his biscuit,<lb/> and own nothing; and
                    we passed the word around,<lb/> "OWN NOTHING;" and "OWN NOTHING!" said we
                    all.<lb/> Our confidence in each other was unshaken. We<lb/> were resolved to
                    succeed or fail together, after the<lb/> calamity had befallen us as much as
                    before. We<lb/> were now prepared for any thing. We were to be<lb/>
                    <pb n="91"/> dragged that morning fifteen miles behind horses,<lb/> and then to
                    be placed in the Easton jail. When we<lb/> reached St. Michael's, we underwent a
                    sort of exami-<lb/> nation. We all denied that we ever intended to run<lb/>
                    away. We did this more to bring out the evidence<lb/> against us, than from any
                    hope of getting clear of<lb/> being sold; for, as I have said, we were ready
                    for<lb/> that. The fact was, we cared but little where we<lb/> went, so we went
                    together. Our greatest concern was<lb/> about separation. We dreaded that more
                    than any<lb/> thing this side of death. We found the evidence<lb/> against us to
                    be the testimony of one person; our<lb/> master would not tell who it was; but
                    we came to<lb/> a unanimous decision among ourselves as to who<lb/> their
                    informant was. We were sent off to the jail at<lb/> Easton. When we got there,
                    we were delivered up<lb/> to the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, and by him<lb/>
                    placed in jail. Henry, John, and myself, were placed<lb/> in one room together
                   â€” Charles, and Henry Bailey,<lb/> in another. Their object in separating
                    us was to<lb/> hinder concert.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes,<lb/> when a swarm of slave traders,
                    and agents for slave<lb/> traders, flocked into jail to look at us, and to
                    as-<lb/> certain if we were for sale. Such a set of beings I<lb/> never saw
                    before! I felt myself surrounded by so<lb/> many fiends from perdition. A band
                    of pirates never<lb/> looked more like their father, the devil. They<lb/>
                    laughed and grinned over us, saying, "Ah, my boys!<lb/> we have got you, haven't
                    we?" And after taunting<lb/> us in various ways, they one by one went into
                    an<lb/> examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value.<lb/> They would
                    impudently ask us if we would not like<lb/> to have them for our masters. We
                    would make them<lb/> no answer, and leave them to find out as best they<lb/>
                    could. Then they would curse and swear at us, telling<lb/>
                    <pb n="92"/> us that they could take the devil out of us in a very<lb/> little
                    while, if we were only in their hands.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>While in jail, we found ourselves in much more<lb/> comfortable quarters than we
                    expected when we<lb/> went there. We did not get much to eat, nor that<lb/>
                    which was very good; but we had a good clean room,<lb/> from the windows of
                    which we could see what was go-<lb/> ing on in the street, which was very much
                    better<lb/> than though we had been placed in one of the dark,<lb/> damp cells.
                    Upon the whole, we got along very well,<lb/> so far as the jail and its keeper
                    were concerned.<lb/> Immediately after the holidays were over, contrary<lb/> to
                    all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Free-<lb/> land came up to Easton,
                    and took Charles, the two<lb/> Henrys, and John, out of jail, and carried
                    them<lb/> home, leaving me alone. I regarded this separation<lb/> as a final
                    one. It caused me more pain than any<lb/> thing else in the whole transaction. I
                    was ready for<lb/> any thing rather than separation. I supposed that<lb/> they
                    had consulted together, and had decided that,<lb/> as I was the whole cause of
                    the intention of the<lb/> others to run away, it was hard to make the
                    innocent<lb/> suffer with the guilty; and that they had, therefore,<lb/>
                    concluded to take the others home, and sell me, as<lb/> a warning to the others
                    that remained. It is due<lb/> to the noble Henry to say, he seemed almost
                    as<lb/> reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home<lb/> to come to the
                    prison. But we knew we should, in<lb/> all probability, be separated, if we were
                    sold; and<lb/> since he was in their hands, he concluded to go<lb/> peaceably
                    home.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was now left to my fate. I was all alone, and<lb/> within the walls of a stone
                    prison. But a few days<lb/> before, and I was full of hope. I expected to
                    have<lb/> been safe in a land of freedom; but now I was cov-<lb/> ered with
                    gloom, sunk down to the utmost despair.<lb/> I thought the possibility of
                    freedom was gone. I<lb/>
                    <pb n="93"/> was kept in this way about one week, at the end<lb/> of which,
                    Captain Auld, my master, to my surprise<lb/> and utter astonishment, came up,
                    and took me out,<lb/> with the intention of sending me, with a gentleman<lb/> of
                    his acquaintance, into Alabama. But, from some<lb/> cause or other, he did not
                    send me to Alabama,<lb/> but concluded to send me back to Baltimore, to<lb/>
                    live again with his brother Hugh, and to learn a<lb/> trade.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Thus, after an absence of three years and one<lb/> month, I was once more
                    permitted to return to my<lb/> old home at Baltimore. My master sent me
                    away,<lb/> because there existed against me a very great preju-<lb/> dice in the
                    community, and he feared I might be<lb/> killed.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master<lb/> Hugh hired me to Mr.
                    William Gardner, an ex-<lb/> tensive ship-builder, on Fell's Point. I was put
                    there<lb/> to learn how to calk. It, however, proved a very<lb/> unfavorable
                    place for the accomplishment of this<lb/> object. Mr. Gardner was engaged that
                    spring in<lb/> building two large man-of-war brigs, professedly for<lb/> the
                    Mexican government. The vessels were to be<lb/> launched in the July of that
                    year, and in failure<lb/> thereof, Mr. Gardner was to lose a considerable
                    sum;<lb/> so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was<lb/> no time to learn
                    any thing. Every man had to do<lb/> that which he knew how to do. In entering
                    the ship-<lb/> yard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do what-<lb/> ever the
                    carpenters commanded me to do. This was<lb/> placing me at the beck and call of
                    about seventy-five<lb/> men. I was to regard all these as masters. Their<lb/>
                    word was to be my law. My situation was a most<lb/> trying one. At times I
                    needed a dozen pair of hands.<lb/> I was called a dozen ways in the space of a
                    single<lb/> minute. Three or four voices would strike my ear<lb/> at the same
                    moment. It wasâ€” "Fred., come help me<lb/>
                    <pb n="94"/> to cant this timber here."â€” "Fred., come carry this<lb/>
                    timber yonder."â€” "Fred., bring that roller here."â€”<lb/> "Fred., go
                    get a fresh can of water."â€” "Fred., come<lb/> help saw off the end of
                    this timber."â€” "Fred., go<lb/> quick, and get the crowbar."â€”
                    "Fred., hold on the<lb/> end of this fall."â€” "Fred., go to the
                    blacksmith's<lb/> shop, and get a new punch."â€” "Hurra, Fred.! run<lb/>
                    and bring me a cold chisel."â€” "I say, Fred., bear a<lb/> hand, and get up
                    a fire as quick as lightning under<lb/> that steam-box."â€” "Halloo,
                    nigger! come, turn this<lb/> grindstone."â€” "Come, come! move, move! and
                    BOWSE<lb/> this timber forward."â€” "I say, darky, blast your eyes,<lb/>
                    why don't you heat up some pitch?"â€” "Halloo!<lb/> halloo! halloo!" (Three
                    voices at the same time.)<lb/> "Come here!â€” Go there!â€” Hold on
                    where you are!<lb/> Damn you, if you move, I'll knock your brains out!"<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>This was my school for eight months; and I might<lb/> have remained there longer,
                    but for a most horrid<lb/> fight I had with four of the white apprentices,
                    in<lb/> which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I<lb/> was horribly
                    mangled in other respects. The facts<lb/> in the case were these: Until a very
                    little while<lb/> after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters<lb/>
                    worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any<lb/> impropriety in it. All
                    hands seemed to be very well<lb/> satisfied. Many of the black carpenters were
                    freemen.<lb/> Things seemed to be going on very well. All at once,<lb/> the
                    white carpenters knocked off, and said they<lb/> would not work with free
                    colored workmen. Their<lb/> reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free
                    colored<lb/> carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take<lb/> the trade
                    into their own hands, and poor white men<lb/> would be thrown out of employment.
                    They therefore<lb/> felt called upon at once to put a stop to it. And,<lb/>
                    taking advantage of Mr. Gardner's necessities, they<lb/> broke off, swearing
                    they would work no longer, unless<lb/> he would discharge his black carpenters. Now,<lb/>
                    <pb n="95"/> though this did not extend to me in form, it did<lb/> reach me in
                    fact. My fellow-apprentices very soon<lb/> began to feel it degrading to them to
                    work with<lb/> me. They began to put on airs, and talk about the<lb/> "niggers"
                    taking the country, saying we all ought to<lb/> be killed; and, being encouraged
                    by the journey-<lb/> men, they commenced making my condition as<lb/> hard as
                    they could, by hectoring me around, and<lb/> sometimes striking me. I, of
                    course, kept the vow<lb/> I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck<lb/>
                    back again, regardless of consequences; and while<lb/> I kept them from
                    combining, I succeeded very well;<lb/> for I could whip the whole of them,
                    taking them<lb/> separately. They, however, at length combined, and<lb/> came
                    upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy<lb/> handspikes. One came in front
                    with a half brick.<lb/> There was one at each side of me, and one behind<lb/>
                    me. While I was attending to those in front, and on<lb/> either side, the one
                    behind ran up with the hand-<lb/> spike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the
                    head.<lb/> It stunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran<lb/> upon me, and
                    fell to beating me with their fists. I<lb/> let them lay on for a while,
                    gathering strength. In<lb/> an instant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to
                    my<lb/> hands and knees. Just as I did that, one of their<lb/> number gave me,
                    with his heavy boot, a powerful<lb/> kick in the left eye. My eyeball seemed to
                    have<lb/> burst. When they saw my eye closed, and badly<lb/> swollen, they left
                    me. With this I seized the hand-<lb/> spike, and for a time pursued them. But
                    here the<lb/> carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as well<lb/> give it
                    up. It was impossible to stand my hand<lb/> against so many. All this took place
                    in sight of not<lb/> less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one<lb/>
                    interposed a friendly word; but some cried, "Kill<lb/> the damned nigger! Kill
                    him! kill him! He struck<lb/> a white person." I found my only chance for life<lb/>
                    <pb n="96"/> was in flight. I succeeded in getting away without<lb/> an
                    additional blow, and barely so; for to strike a<lb/> white man is death by Lynch
                    law,â€” and that was the<lb/> law in Mr. Gardner's ship-yard; nor is there
                    much<lb/> of any other out of Mr. Gardner's ship-yard.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I went directly home, and told the story of my<lb/> wrongs to Master Hugh; and I
                    am happy to say of<lb/> him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was
                    heavenly,<lb/> compared with that of his brother Thomas under<lb/> similar
                    circumstances. He listened attentively to my<lb/> narration of the circumstances
                    leading to the savage<lb/> outrage, and gave many proofs of his strong
                    indigna-<lb/> tion at it. The heart of my once overkind mistress<lb/> was again
                    melted into pity. My puffed-out eye and<lb/> blood-covered face moved her to
                    tears. She took a<lb/> chair by me, washed the blood from my face, and,<lb/>
                    with a mother's tenderness, bound up my head,<lb/> covering the wounded eye with
                    a lean piece of fresh<lb/> beef. It was almost compensation for my
                    suffering<lb/> to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness<lb/> from
                    this, my once affectionate old mistress. Master<lb/> Hugh was very much enraged.
                    He gave expression<lb/> to his feelings by pouring out curses upon the
                    heads<lb/> of those who did the deed. As soon as I got a little<lb/> the better
                    of my bruises, he took me with him to<lb/> Esquire Watson's, on Bond Street, to
                    see what could<lb/> be done about the matter. Mr. Watson inquired who<lb/> saw
                    the assault committed. Master Hugh told him<lb/> it was done in Mr. Gardner's
                    ship-yard at midday,<lb/> where there were a large company of men at work.<lb/>
                    "As to that," he said, "the deed was done, and there<lb/> was no question as to
                    who did it." His answer was,<lb/> he could do nothing in the case, unless some
                    white<lb/> man would come forward and testify. He could<lb/> issue no warrant on
                    my word. If I had been killed<lb/> in the presence of a thousand colored people,
                    their<lb/> testimony combined would have been insufficient<lb/>
                    <pb n="97"/> to have arrested one of the murderers. Master Hugh,<lb/> for once,
                    was compelled to say this state of things<lb/> was too bad. Of course, it was
                    impossible to get any<lb/> white man to volunteer his testimony in my
                    behalf,<lb/> and against the white young men. Even those who<lb/> may have
                    sympathized with me were not prepared<lb/> to do this. It required a degree of
                    courage unknown<lb/> to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightest<lb/>
                    manifestation of humanity toward a colored person<lb/> was denounced as
                    abolitionism, and that name sub-<lb/> jected its bearer to frightful
                    liabilities. The watch-<lb/> words of the bloody-minded in that region, and
                    in<lb/> those days, were, "Damn the abolitionists!" and<lb/> "Damn the niggers!"
                    There was nothing done, and<lb/> probably nothing would have been done if I
                    had<lb/> been killed. Such was, and such remains, the state<lb/> of things in
                    the Christian city of Baltimore.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Master Hugh, finding he could get no redress, re-<lb/> fused to let me go back
                    again to Mr. Gardner. He<lb/> kept me himself, and his wife dressed my
                    wound<lb/> till I was again restored to health. He then took me<lb/> into the
                    ship-yard of which he was foreman, in the<lb/> employment of Mr. Walter Price.
                    There I was im-<lb/> mediately set to calking, and very soon learned the<lb/>
                    art of using my mallet and irons. In the course of<lb/> one year from the time I
                    left Mr. Gardner's, I was<lb/> able to command the highest wages given to
                    the<lb/> most experienced calkers. I was now of some impor-<lb/> tance to my
                    master. I was bringing him from six<lb/> to seven dollars per week. I sometimes
                    brought him<lb/> nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and<lb/> a half a
                    day. After learning how to calk, I sought<lb/> my own employment, made my own
                    contracts, and<lb/> collected the money which I earned. My pathway<lb/> became
                    much more smooth than before; my condi-<lb/> tion was now much more comfortable.
                    When I could<lb/> get no calking to do, I did nothing. During these<lb/>
                    <pb n="98"/> leisure times, those old notions about freedom would<lb/> steal
                    over me again. When in Mr. Gardner's employ-<lb/> ment, I was kept in such a
                    perpetual whirl of ex-<lb/> citement, I could think of nothing, scarcely,
                    but<lb/> my life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot<lb/> my liberty. I
                    have observed this in my experience<lb/> of slavery,â€” that whenever my
                    condition was im-<lb/> proved, instead of its increasing my contentment,<lb/> it
                    only increased my desire to be free, and set me to<lb/> thinking of plans to
                    gain my freedom. I have found<lb/> that, to make a contented slave, it is
                    necessary to<lb/> make a thoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his<lb/>
                    moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to<lb/> annihilate the power
                    of reason. He must be able to<lb/> detect no inconsistencies in slavery; he must
                    be made<lb/> to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought<lb/> to that
                    only when he ceases to be a man.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and<lb/> fifty cents per day. I
                    contracted for it; I earned it;<lb/> it was paid to me; it was rightfully my
                    own; yet,<lb/> upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled<lb/> to
                    deliver every cent of that money to Master Hugh.<lb/> And why? Not because he
                    earned it,â€” not because<lb/> he had any hand in earning it,â€” not
                    because I owed<lb/> it to him,â€” nor because he possessed the
                    slightest<lb/> shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had<lb/> the power
                    to compel me to give it up. The right of<lb/> the grim-visaged pirate upon the
                    high seas is exactly<lb/> the same.<lb/>

                <p>I now come to that part of my life during which I<lb/> planned, and finally
                    succeeded in making, my escape<lb/> from slavery. But before narrating any of
                    the pe-<lb/> culiar circumstances, I deem it proper to make<lb/> known my
                    intention not to state all the facts con-<lb/> nected with the transaction. My
                    reasons for pursuing<lb/> this course may be understood from the following:<lb/>
                    First, were I to give a minute statement of all the<lb/> facts, it is not only
                    possible, but quite probable, that<lb/> others would thereby be involved in the
                    most embar-<lb/> rassing difficulties. Secondly, such a statement would<lb/>
                    most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the<lb/> part of slaveholders than
                    has existed heretofore<lb/> among them; which would, of course, be the
                    means<lb/> of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bond-<lb/> man might
                    escape his galling chains. I deeply regret<lb/> the necessity that impels me to
                    suppress any thing<lb/> of importance connected with my experience in<lb/>
                    slavery. It would afford me great pleasure indeed,<lb/> as well as materially
                    add to the interest of my nar-<lb/> rative, were I at liberty to gratify a
                    curiosity, which<lb/> I know exists in the minds of many, by an accurate<lb/>
                    statement of all the facts pertaining to my most<lb/> fortunate escape. But I
                    must deprive myself of this<lb/> pleasure, and the curious of the gratification
                    which<lb/> such a statement would afford. I would allow my-<lb/> self to suffer
                    under the greatest imputations which<lb/> evil-minded men might suggest, rather
                    than excul-<lb/> pate myself, and thereby run the hazard of closing<lb/> the
                    slightest avenue by which a brother slave might<lb/>
                    <pb n="100"/> clear himself of the chains and fetters of slavery.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have never approved of the very public manner<lb/> in which some of our western
                    friends have conducted<lb/> what they call the UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, but
                    which<lb/> I think, by their open declarations, has been made<lb/> most
                    emphatically the UPPERGROUND RAILROAD. I honor<lb/> those good men and women for
                    their noble daring,<lb/> and applaud them for willingly subjecting them-<lb/>
                    selves to bloody persecution, by openly avowing their<lb/> participation in the
                    escape of slaves. I, however, can<lb/> see very little good resulting from such
                    a course,<lb/> either to themselves or the slaves escaping; while,<lb/> upon the
                    other hand, I see and feel assured that<lb/> those open declarations are a
                    positive evil to the<lb/> slaves remaining, who are seeking to escape. They<lb/>
                    do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst<lb/> they do much towards
                    enlightening the master.<lb/> They stimulate him to greater watchfulness,
                    and<lb/> enhance his power to capture his slave. We owe<lb/> something to the
                    slave south of the line as well as<lb/> to those north of it; and in aiding the
                    latter on their<lb/> way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing<lb/>
                    which would be likely to hinder the former from<lb/> escaping from slavery. I
                    would keep the merciless<lb/> slaveholder profoundly ignorant of the means
                    of<lb/> flight adopted by the slave. I would leave him to<lb/> imagine himself
                    surrounded by myriads of invisible<lb/> tormentors, ever ready to snatch from
                    his infernal<lb/> grasp his trembling prey. Let him be left to feel<lb/> his way
                    in the dark; let darkness commensurate with<lb/> his crime hover over him; and
                    let him feel that at<lb/> every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying
                    bondman,<lb/> he is running the frightful risk of having his hot<lb/> brains
                    dashed out by an invisible agency. Let us<lb/> render the tyrant no aid; let us
                    not hold the light<lb/> by which he can trace the footprints of our flying<lb/>
                    brother. But enough of this. I will now proceed to<lb/>
                    <pb n="101"/> the statement of those facts, connected with my<lb/> escape, for
                    which I am alone responsible, and for<lb/> which no one can be made to suffer
                    but myself.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In the early part of the year 1838, I became quite<lb/> restless. I could see no
                    reason why I should, at the<lb/> end of each week, pour the reward of my toil
                    into<lb/> the purse of my master. When I carried to him my<lb/> weekly wages, he
                    would, after counting the money,<lb/> look me in the face with a robber-like
                    fierceness,<lb/> and ask, "Is this all?" He was satisfied with nothing<lb/> less
                    than the last cent. He would, however, when I<lb/> made him six dollars,
                    sometimes give me six cents,<lb/> to encourage me. It had the opposite effect. I
                    re-<lb/> garded it as a sort of admission of my right to the<lb/> whole. The
                    fact that he gave me any part of my<lb/> wages was proof, to my mind, that he
                    believed me<lb/> entitled to the whole of them. I always felt worse<lb/> for
                    having received any thing; for I feared that the<lb/> giving me a few cents
                    would ease his conscience,<lb/> and make him feel himself to be a pretty
                    honorable<lb/> sort of robber. My discontent grew upon me. I was<lb/> ever on
                    the look-out for means of escape; and, find-<lb/> ing no direct means, I
                    determined to try to hire my<lb/> time, with a view of getting money with which
                    to<lb/> make my escape. In the spring of 1838, when Master<lb/> Thomas came to
                    Baltimore to purchase his spring<lb/> goods, I got an opportunity, and applied
                    to him to<lb/> allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatingly refused<lb/> my
                    request, and told me this was another stratagem<lb/> by which to escape. He told
                    me I could go nowhere<lb/> but that he could get me; and that, in the event<lb/>
                    of my running away, he should spare no pains in his<lb/> efforts to catch me. He
                    exhorted me to content<lb/> myself, and be obedient. He told me, if I would<lb/>
                    be happy, I must lay out no plans for the future.<lb/> He said, if I behaved
                    myself properly, he would take<lb/> care of me. Indeed, he advised me to complete<lb/>
                    <pb n="102"/> thoughtlessness of the future, and taught me to de-<lb/> pend
                    solely upon him for happiness. He seemed to<lb/> see fully the pressing
                    necessity of setting aside my<lb/> intellectual nature, in order to contentment
                    in<lb/> slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite of<lb/> myself, I
                    continued to think, and to think about<lb/> the injustice of my enslavement, and
                    the means of<lb/> escape.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>About two months after this, I applied to Master<lb/> Hugh for the privilege of
                    hiring my time. He was<lb/> not acquainted with the fact that I had applied
                    to<lb/> Master Thomas, and had been refused. He too, at<lb/> first, seemed
                    disposed to refuse; but, after some re-<lb/> flection, he granted me the
                    privilege, and proposed<lb/> the following terms: I was to be allowed all
                    my<lb/> time, make all contracts with those for whom I<lb/> worked, and find my
                    own employment; and, in re-<lb/> turn for this liberty, I was to pay him three
                    dollars<lb/> at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools,<lb/> and in
                    board and clothing. My board was two dol-<lb/> lars and a half per week. This,
                    with the wear and<lb/> tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular<lb/>
                    expenses about six dollars per week. This amount<lb/> I was compelled to make
                    up, or relinquish the<lb/> privilege of hiring my time. Rain or shine, work
                    or<lb/> no work, at the end of each week the money must<lb/> be forthcoming, or
                    I must give up my privilege. This<lb/> arrangement, it will be perceived, was
                    decidedly in<lb/> my master's favor. It relieved him of all need of<lb/> looking
                    after me. His money was sure. He received<lb/> all the benefits of slaveholding
                    without its evils;<lb/> while I endured all the evils of a slave, and
                    suffered<lb/> all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I found it a<lb/> hard
                    bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better<lb/> than the old mode of
                    getting along. It was a step<lb/> towards freedom to be allowed to bear the
                    respon-<lb/> sibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold<lb/>
                    <pb n="103"/> on upon it. I bent myself to the work of making<lb/> money. I was
                    ready to work at night as well as day,<lb/> and by the most untiring
                    perseverance and industry,<lb/> I made enough to meet my expenses, and lay
                    up<lb/> a little money every week. I went on thus from May<lb/> till August.
                    Master Hugh then refused to allow me<lb/> to hire my time longer. The ground for
                    his refusal<lb/> was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay<lb/> him
                    for my week's time. This failure was occasioned<lb/> by my attending a camp
                    meeting about ten miles<lb/> from Baltimore. During the week, I had entered<lb/>
                    into an engagement with a number of young friends<lb/> to start from Baltimore
                    to the camp ground early<lb/> Saturday evening; and being detained by my
                    em-<lb/> ployer, I was unable to get down to Master Hugh's<lb/> without
                    disappointing the company. I knew that<lb/> Master Hugh was in no special need
                    of the money<lb/> that night. I therefore decided to go to camp meet-<lb/> ing,
                    and upon my return pay him the three dollars.<lb/> I staid at the camp meeting
                    one day longer than I<lb/> intended when I left. But as soon as I returned,
                    I<lb/> called upon him to pay him what he considered his<lb/> due. I found him
                    very angry; he could scarce restrain<lb/> his wrath. He said he had a great mind
                    to give me a<lb/> severe whipping. He wished to know how I dared<lb/> go out of
                    the city without asking his permission. I<lb/> told him I hired my time and
                    while I paid him the<lb/> price which he asked for it, I did not know that
                    I<lb/> was bound to ask him when and where I should go.<lb/> This reply troubled
                    him; and, after reflecting a few<lb/> moments, he turned to me, and said I
                    should hire<lb/> my time no longer; that the next thing he should<lb/> know of,
                    I would be running away. Upon the same<lb/> plea, he told me to bring my tools
                    and clothing<lb/> home forthwith. I did so; but instead of seeking<lb/> work, as
                    I had been accustomed to do previously to<lb/> hiring my time, I spent the whole
                    week without<lb/>
                    <pb n="104"/> the performance of a single stroke of work. I did this<lb/> in
                    retaliation. Saturday night, he called upon me<lb/> as usual for my week's
                    wages. I told him I had no<lb/> wages; I had done no work that week. Here
                    we<lb/> were upon the point of coming to blows. He raved,<lb/> and swore his
                    determination to get hold of me. I did<lb/> not allow myself a single word; but
                    was resolved, if<lb/> he laid the weight of his hand upon me, it should<lb/> be
                    blow for blow. He did not strike me, but told me<lb/> that he would find me in
                    constant employment in<lb/> future. I thought the matter over during the next
                    day,<lb/> Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of<lb/> September, as
                    the day upon which I would make a<lb/> second attempt to secure my freedom. I
                    now had<lb/> three weeks during which to prepare for my journey.<lb/> Early on
                    Monday morning, before Master Hugh had<lb/> time to make any engagement for me,
                    I went out<lb/> and got employment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard<lb/> near the
                    drawbridge, upon what is called the City<lb/> Block, thus making it unnecessary
                    for him to seek<lb/> employment for me. At the end of the week, I<lb/> brought
                    him between eight and nine dollars. He<lb/> seemed very well pleased, and asked
                    why I did not<lb/> do the same the week before. He little knew what<lb/> my
                    plans were. My object in working steadily was<lb/> to remove any suspicion he
                    might entertain of my<lb/> intent to run away; and in this I succeeded
                    admi-<lb/> rably. I suppose he thought I was never better<lb/> satisfied with my
                    condition than at the very time<lb/> during which I was planning my escape. The
                    second<lb/> week passed, and again I carried him my full wages;<lb/> and so well
                    pleased was he, that he gave me twenty-<lb/> five cents, (quite a large sum for
                    a slaveholder to<lb/> give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it.<lb/>
                    I told him I would.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Things went on without very smoothly indeed,<lb/> but within there was trouble.
                    It is impossible for<lb/>
                    <pb n="105"/> me to describe my feelings as the time of my con-<lb/> templated
                    start drew near. I had a number of warm-<lb/> hearted friends in Baltimore,
                   â€” friends that I loved<lb/> almost as I did my life,â€” and the
                    thought of being<lb/> separated from them forever was painful beyond<lb/>
                    expression. It is my opinion that thousands would<lb/> escape from slavery, who
                    now remain, but for the<lb/> strong cords of affection that bind them to
                    their<lb/> friends. The thought of leaving my friends was de-<lb/> cidedly the
                    most painful thought with which I had<lb/> to contend. The love of them was my
                    tender point,<lb/> and shook my decision more than all things else.<lb/> Besides
                    the pain of separation, the dread and appre-<lb/> hension of a failure exceeded
                    what I had experienced<lb/> at my first attempt. The appalling defeat I
                    then<lb/> sustained returned to torment me. I felt assured<lb/> that, if I
                    failed in this attempt, my case would be<lb/> a hopeless oneâ€” it would
                    seal my fate as a slave for-<lb/> ever. I could not hope to get off with any
                    thing less<lb/> than the severest punishment, and being placed<lb/> beyond the
                    means of escape. It required no very<lb/> vivid imagination to depict the most
                    frightful<lb/> scenes through which I should have to pass, in case<lb/> I
                    failed. The wretchedness of slavery, and the<lb/> blessedness of freedom, were
                    perpetually before me.<lb/> It was life and death with me. But I remained<lb/>
                    firm, and, according to my resolution, on the third<lb/> day of September, 1838,
                    I left my chains, and suc-<lb/> ceeded in reaching New York without the
                    slightest<lb/> interruption of any kind. How I did so,â€” what means<lb/> I
                    adopted,â€” what direction I travelled, and by what<lb/> mode of
                    conveyance,â€” I must leave unexplained,<lb/> for the reasons before
                    mentioned.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I have been frequently asked how I felt when I<lb/> found myself in a free State.
                    I have never been able<lb/> to answer the question with any satisfaction to
                    my-<lb/> self. It was a moment of the highest excitement I<lb/>
                    <pb n="106"/> ever experienced. I suppose I felt as one may imagine<lb/> the
                    unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued<lb/> by a friendly man-of-war from
                    the pursuit of a pirate.<lb/> In writing to a dear friend, immediately after
                    my<lb/> arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had<lb/> escaped a den
                    of hungry lions. This state of mind,<lb/> however, very soon subsided; and I was
                    again seized<lb/> with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I<lb/> was
                    yet liable to be taken back, and subjected to<lb/> all the tortures of slavery.
                    This in itself was enough<lb/> to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the
                    lone-<lb/> liness overcame me. There I was in the midst of<lb/> thousands, and
                    yet a perfect stranger; without home<lb/> and without friends, in the midst of
                    thousands of my<lb/> own brethrenâ€” children of a common Father, and<lb/>
                    yet I dared not to unfold to any one of them my<lb/> sad condition. I was afraid
                    to speak to any one for<lb/> fear of speaking to the wrong one, and thereby
                    fall-<lb/> ing into the hands of money-loving kidnappers,<lb/> whose business it
                    was to lie in wait for the panting<lb/> fugitive, as the ferocious beasts of the
                    forest lie in<lb/> wait for their prey. The motto which I adopted<lb/> when I
                    started from slavery was thisâ€” "Trust no<lb/> man!" I saw in every white
                    man an enemy, and in<lb/> almost every colored man cause for distrust. It
                    was<lb/> a most painful situation; and, to understand it, one<lb/> must needs
                    experience it, or imagine himself in<lb/> similar circumstances. Let him be a
                    fugitive slave in<lb/> a strange landâ€” a land given up to be the
                    hunting-<lb/> ground for slaveholdersâ€” whose inhabitants are legal-<lb/>
                    ized kidnappersâ€” where he is every moment sub-<lb/> jected to the
                    terrible liability of being seized upon<lb/> by his fellowmen, as the hideous
                    crocodile seizes<lb/> upon his prey!â€” I say, let him place himself in
                    my<lb/> situationâ€” without home or friendsâ€” without money<lb/> or
                    creditâ€” wanting shelter, and no one to give itâ€”<lb/> wanting
                    bread, and no money to buy it,â€” and at the<lb/>
                    <pb n="107"/> same time let him feel that he is pursued by merci-<lb/> less
                    men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what<lb/> to do, where to go, or where
                    to stay,â€” perfectly help-<lb/> less both as to the means of defence and
                    means of<lb/> escape,â€” in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the
                    ter-<lb/> rible gnawings of hunger,â€” in the midst of houses,<lb/> yet
                    having no home,â€” among fellow-men, yet feeling<lb/> as if in the midst of
                    wild beasts, whose greediness<lb/> to swallow up the trembling and half-famished
                    fugi-<lb/> tive is only equalled by that with which the monsters<lb/> of the
                    deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which<lb/> they subsist,â€” I say,
                    let him be placed in this most<lb/> trying situation,â€” the situation in
                    which I was placed,<lb/>â€” then, and not till then, will he fully
                    appreciate the<lb/> hardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the<lb/>
                    toil-worn and whip-scarred fugitive slave.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Thank Heaven, I remained but a short time in<lb/> this distressed situation. I
                    was relieved from it by the<lb/> humane hand of Mr. DAVID RUGGLES, whose
                    vigi-<lb/> lance, kindness, and perseverance, I shall never for-<lb/> get. I am
                    glad of an opportunity to express, as far as<lb/> words can, the love and
                    gratitude I bear him. Mr.<lb/> Ruggles is now afflicted with blindness, and is
                    him-<lb/> self in need of the same kind offices which he was<lb/> once so
                    forward in the performance of toward others.<lb/> I had been in New York but a
                    few days, when Mr.<lb/> Ruggles sought me out, and very kindly took me<lb/> to
                    his boarding-house at the corner of Church and<lb/> Lespenard Streets. Mr.
                    Ruggles was then very deeply<lb/> engaged in the memorable DARG case, as well as
                    at-<lb/> tending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devis-<lb/> ing ways and
                    means for their successful escape; and,<lb/> though watched and hemmed in on
                    almost every<lb/> side, he seemed to be more than a match for his<lb/>
                    enemies.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Very soon after I went to Mr. Ruggles, he wished<lb/> to know of me where I
                    wanted to go; as he deemed<lb/>
                    <pb n="108"/> it unsafe for me to remain in New York. I told him<lb/> I was a
                    calker, and should like to go where I could<lb/> get work. I thought of going to
                    Canada; but he de-<lb/> cided against it, and in favor of my going to New<lb/>
                    Bedford, thinking I should be able to get work there<lb/> at my trade. At this
                    time, Anna,* my intended wife,<lb/> came on; for I wrote to her immediately
                    after my<lb/> arrival at New York, (notwithstanding my homeless,<lb/> houseless,
                    and helpless condition,) informing her of<lb/> my successful flight, and wishing
                    her to come on<lb/> forthwith. In a few days after her arrival, Mr. Rug-<lb/>
                    gles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, who, in<lb/> the presence of Mr.
                    Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and<lb/> two or three others, performed the marriage
                    cere-<lb/> mony, and gave us a certificate, of which the fol-<lb/> lowing is an
                    exact copy:â€”<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>"This may certify, that I joined together in holy<lb/> matrimony Frederick
                    Johnson+ and Anna Murray, as<lb/> man and wife, in the presence of Mr. David
                    Ruggles<lb/> and Mrs. Michaels.<lb/>

                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Upon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar<lb/> bill from Mr. Ruggles, I
                    shouldered one part of our<lb/> baggage, and Anna took up the other, and we
                    set<lb/> out forthwith to take passage on board of the steam-<lb/> boat John W.
                    Richmond for Newport, on our way<lb/> to New Bedford. Mr. Ruggles gave me a
                    letter to a<lb/> Mr. Shaw in Newport, and told me, in case my<lb/> money did not
                    serve me to New Bedford, to stop in<lb/> Newport and obtain further assistance;
                    but upon our<lb/>

                </p>
                <p>+I had changed my name from Frederick BAILEY to that of<lb/> JOHNSON.<lb/>
                    <pb n="109"/> arrival at Newport, we were so anxious to get to a<lb/> place of
                    safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked the<lb/> necessary money to pay our
                    fare, we decided to take<lb/> seats in the stage, and promise to pay when we
                    got<lb/> to New Bedford. We were encouraged to do this by<lb/> two excellent
                    gentlemen, residents of New Bedford,<lb/> whose names I afterward ascertained to
                    be Joseph<lb/> Ricketson and William C. Taber. They seemed at<lb/> once to
                    understand our circumstances, and gave us<lb/> such assurance of their
                    friendliness as put us fully<lb/> at ease in their presence. It was good indeed
                    to meet<lb/> with such friends, at such a time. Upon reaching<lb/> New Bedford,
                    we were directed to the house of Mr.<lb/> Nathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly
                    received,<lb/> and hospitably provided for. Both Mr. and Mrs.<lb/> Johnson took
                    a deep and lively interest in our wel-<lb/> fare. They proved themselves quite
                    worthy of the<lb/> name of abolitionists. When the stage-driver found<lb/> us
                    unable to pay our fare, he held on upon our bag-<lb/> gage as security for the
                    debt. I had but to mention<lb/> the fact to Mr. Johnson, and he forthwith
                    advanced<lb/> the money.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>We now began to feel a degree of safety, and to<lb/> prepare ourselves for the
                    duties and responsibilities<lb/> of a life of freedom. On the morning after our
                    ar-<lb/> rival at New Bedford, while at the breakfast-table,<lb/> the question
                    arose as to what name I should be<lb/> called by. The name given me by my mother
                    was,<lb/> "Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey." I, how-<lb/> ever, had
                    dispensed with the two middle names long<lb/> before I left Maryland so that I
                    was generally known<lb/> by the name of "Frederick Bailey." I started from<lb/>
                    Baltimore bearing the name of "Stanley." When I<lb/> got to New York, I again
                    changed my name to "Fred-<lb/> erick Johnson," and thought that would be the
                    last<lb/> change. But when I got to New Bedford, I found it<lb/>
                    <pb n="110"/> necessary again to change my name. The reason of<lb/> this
                    necessity was, that there were so many Johnsons<lb/> in New Bedford, it was
                    already quite difficult to<lb/> distinguish between them. I gave Mr. Johnson
                    the<lb/> privilege of choosing me a name, but told him he<lb/> must not take
                    from me the name of "Frederick."<lb/> I must hold on to that, to preserve a
                    sense of my<lb/> identity. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the<lb/> "Lady of
                    the Lake," and at once suggested that my<lb/> name be "Douglass." From that time
                    until now I<lb/> have been called "Frederick Douglass;" and as I am<lb/> more
                    widely known by that name than by either of<lb/> the others, I shall continue to
                    use it as my own.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I was quite disappointed at the general appear-<lb/> ance of things in New
                    Bedford. The impression<lb/> which I had received respecting the character
                    and<lb/> condition of the people of the north, I found to be<lb/> singularly
                    erroneous. I had very strangely supposed,<lb/> while in slavery, that few of the
                    comforts, and<lb/> scarcely any of the luxuries, of life were enjoyed at<lb/>
                    the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the<lb/> slaveholders of the
                    south. I probably came to this<lb/> conclusion from the fact that northern
                    people owned<lb/> no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a<lb/> level
                    with the non-slaveholding population of the<lb/> south. I knew THEY were
                    exceedingly poor, and I had<lb/> been accustomed to regard their poverty as the
                    nec-<lb/> essary consequence of their being non-slaveholders.<lb/> I had somehow
                    imbibed the opinion that, in the<lb/> absence of slaves, there could be no
                    wealth, and very<lb/> little refinement. And upon coming to the north, I<lb/>
                    expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, and<lb/> uncultivated population,
                    living in the most Spartan-<lb/> like simplicity, knowing nothing of the ease,
                    luxury,<lb/> pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Such<lb/> being my
                    conjectures, any one acquainted with the<lb/>
                    <pb n="111"/> appearance of New Bedford may very readily infer<lb/> how palpably
                    I must have seen my mistake.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In the afternoon of the day when I reached New<lb/> Bedford, I visited the
                    wharves, to take a view of the<lb/> shipping. Here I found myself surrounded
                    with the<lb/> strongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and<lb/> riding
                    in the stream, I saw many ships of the finest<lb/> model, in the best order, and
                    of the largest size.<lb/> Upon the right and left, I was walled in by
                    granite<lb/> warehouses of the widest dimensions, stowed to their<lb/> utmost
                    capacity with the necessaries and comforts<lb/> of life. Added to this, almost
                    every body seemed to<lb/> be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with
                    what<lb/> I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were<lb/> no loud songs
                    heard from those engaged in loading<lb/> and unloading ships. I heard no deep
                    oaths or horrid<lb/> curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of men;<lb/> but
                    all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man ap-<lb/> peared to understand his work,
                    and went at it with<lb/> a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened<lb/>
                    the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing,<lb/> as well as a sense of
                    his own dignity as a man. To me<lb/> this looked exceedingly strange. From the
                    wharves I<lb/> strolled around and over the town, gazing with won-<lb/> der and
                    admiration at the splendid churches, beauti-<lb/> ful dwellings, and
                    finely-cultivated gardens; evincing<lb/> an amount of wealth, comfort, taste,
                    and refinement,<lb/> such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholding<lb/>
                    Maryland.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I<lb/> saw few or no dilapidated
                    houses, with poverty-<lb/> stricken inmates; no half-naked children and
                    bare-<lb/> footed women, such as I had been accustomed to see<lb/> in
                    Hillsborough, Easton, St. Michael's, and Balti-<lb/> more. The people looked
                    more able, stronger, health-<lb/> ier, and happier, than those of Maryland. I
                    was for<lb/>
                    <pb n="112"/> once made glad by a view of extreme wealth, without<lb/> being
                    saddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the<lb/> most astonishing as well as the
                    most interesting thing<lb/> to me was the condition of the colored people,
                    a<lb/> great many of whom, like myself, had escaped<lb/> thither as a refuge
                    from the hunters of men. I found<lb/> many, who had not been seven years out of
                    their<lb/> chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying<lb/> more of
                    the comforts of life, than the average of<lb/> slaveholders in Maryland. I will
                    venture to assert,<lb/> that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (of whom I<lb/> can
                    say with a grateful heart, "I was hungry, and he<lb/> gave me meat; I was
                    thirsty, and he gave me drink;<lb/> I was a stranger, and he took me in") lived
                    in a<lb/> neater house; dined at a better table; took, paid<lb/> for, and read,
                    more newspapers; better understood<lb/> the moral, religious, and political
                    character of the<lb/> nation,â€” than nine tenths of the slaveholders in
                    Tal-<lb/> bot county Maryland. Yet Mr. Johnson was a work-<lb/> ing man. His
                    hands were hardened by toil, and not<lb/> his alone, but those also of Mrs.
                    Johnson. I found the<lb/> colored people much more spirited than I had sup-<lb/>
                    posed they would be. I found among them a deter-<lb/> mination to protect each
                    other from the blood-thirsty<lb/> kidnapper, at all hazards. Soon after my
                    arrival, I<lb/> was told of a circumstance which illustrated their<lb/> spirit.
                    A colored man and a fugitive slave were on<lb/> unfriendly terms. The former was
                    heard to threaten<lb/> the latter with informing his master of his where-<lb/>
                    abouts. Straightway a meeting was called among the<lb/> colored people, under
                    the stereotyped notice, "Busi-<lb/> ness of importance!" The betrayer was
                    invited to at-<lb/> tend. The people came at the appointed hour, and<lb/>
                    organized the meeting by appointing a very religious<lb/> old gentleman as
                    president, who, I believe, made a<lb/> prayer, after which he addressed the
                    meeting as fol-<lb/> lows: "FRIENDS, WE HAVE GOT HIM HERE, AND I WOULD<lb/>
                    <pb n="113"/> RECOMMEND THAT YOU YOUNG MEN JUST TAKE HIM OUT-<lb/> SIDE THE
                    DOOR, AND KILL HIM!" With this, a number<lb/> of them bolted at him; but they
                    were intercepted<lb/> by some more timid than themselves, and the be-<lb/>
                    trayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been<lb/> seen in New Bedford since.
                    I believe there have<lb/> been no more such threats, and should there be
                    here-<lb/> after, I doubt not that death would be the conse-<lb/> quence.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I found employment, the third day after my ar-<lb/> rival, in stowing a sloop
                    with a load of oil. It was<lb/> new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at
                    it<lb/> with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my<lb/> own master. It
                    was a happy moment, the rapture of<lb/> which can be understood only by those
                    who have<lb/> been slaves. It was the first work, the reward of<lb/> which was
                    to be entirely my own. There was no Mas-<lb/> ter Hugh standing ready, the
                    moment I earned the<lb/> money, to rob me of it. I worked that day with a<lb/>
                    pleasure I had never before experienced. I was at<lb/> work for myself and
                    newly-married wife. It was to me<lb/> the starting-point of a new existence.
                    When I got<lb/> through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job of<lb/>
                    calking; but such was the strength of prejudice<lb/> against color, among the
                    white calkers, that they re-<lb/> fused to work with me, and of course I could
                    get no<lb/> employment.* Finding my trade of no immediate<lb/> benefit, I threw
                    off my calking habiliments, and pre-<lb/> pared myself to do any kind of work I
                    could get to<lb/> do. Mr. Johnson kindly let me have his wood-horse<lb/> and
                    saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of<lb/> work. There was no work too
                    hardâ€” none too dirty.<lb/> I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry
                    wood,<lb/> sweep the chimney, or roll oil casks,â€” all of which I<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>* I am told that colored persons can now get employment<lb/> at calking in New
                    Bedfordâ€” a result of anti-slavery effort.<lb/>
                    <pb n="114"/> did for nearly three years in New Bedford, before I<lb/> became
                    known to the anti-slavery world.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>In about four months after I went to New Bed-<lb/> ford, there came a young man
                    to me, and inquired<lb/> if I did not wish to take the "Liberator." I told
                    him<lb/> I did; but, just having made my escape from slavery,<lb/> I remarked
                    that I was unable to pay for it then. I,<lb/> however, finally became a
                    subscriber to it. The paper<lb/> came, and I read it from week to week with
                    such<lb/> feelings as it would be quite idle for me to attempt<lb/> to describe.
                    The paper became my meat and my<lb/> drink. My soul was set all on fire. Its
                    sympathy for<lb/> my brethren in bondsâ€” its scathing denunciations
                    of<lb/> slaveholdersâ€” its faithful exposures of slaveryâ€” and
                    its<lb/> powerful attacks upon the upholders of the institu-<lb/> tionâ€”
                    sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as<lb/> I had never felt before!<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I had not long been a reader of the "Liberator,"<lb/> before I got a pretty
                    correct idea of the principles,<lb/> measures and spirit of the anti-slavery
                    reform. I took<lb/> right hold of the cause. I could do but little; but<lb/>
                    what I could, I did with a joyful heart, and never felt<lb/> happier than when
                    in an anti-slavery meeting. I sel-<lb/> dom had much to say at the meetings,
                    because what<lb/> I wanted to say was said so much better by others.<lb/> But,
                    while attending an anti-slavery convention at<lb/> Nantucket, on the 11th of
                    August, 1841, I felt<lb/> strongly moved to speak, and was at the same time<lb/>
                    much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a<lb/> gentleman who had heard me
                    speak in the colored<lb/> people's meeting at New Bedford. It was a severe<lb/>
                    cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was,<lb/> I felt myself a slave,
                    and the idea of speaking to<lb/> white people weighed me down. I spoke but a
                    few<lb/> moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said<lb/> what I desired
                    with considerable ease. From that<lb/>
                    <pb n="115"/> time until now, I have been engaged in pleading the<lb/> cause of
                    my brethrenâ€” with what success, and with<lb/> what devotion, I leave
                    those acquainted with my la-<lb/> bors to decide.<lb/>

                <p> APPENDIX<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I find, since reading over the foregoing Narrative,<lb/> that I have, in several
                    instances, spoken in such a<lb/> tone and manner, respecting religion, as may
                    possi-<lb/> bly lead those unacquainted with my religious views<lb/> to suppose
                    me an opponent of all religion. To re-<lb/> move the liability of such
                    misapprehension, I deem<lb/> it proper to append the following brief
                    explanation.<lb/> What I have said respecting and against religion, I<lb/> mean
                    strictly to apply to the SLAVEHOLDING RELIGION of<lb/> this land, and with no
                    possible reference to Christi-<lb/> anity proper; for, between the Christianity
                    of this<lb/> land, and the Christianity of Christ, I recognize the<lb/> widest
                    possible differenceâ€” so wide, that to receive<lb/> the one as good, pure,
                    and holy, is of necessity to re-<lb/> ject the other as bad, corrupt, and
                    wicked. To be the<lb/> friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy<lb/>
                    of the other. I love the pure, peaceable, and impar-<lb/> tial Christianity of
                    Christ: I therefore hate the cor-<lb/> rupt, slaveholding, women-whipping,
                    cradle-plunder-<lb/> ing, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this
                    land.<lb/> Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful<lb/> one, for
                    calling the religion of this land Christianity.<lb/> I look upon it as the
                    climax of all misnomers, the<lb/> boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all
                    libels.<lb/> Never was there a clearer case of "stealing the livery<lb/> of the
                    court of heaven to serve the devil in." I am<lb/> filled with unutterable
                    loathing when I contem-<lb/> plate the religious pomp and show, together with
                    the<lb/> horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround<lb/> me. We have
                    men-stealers for ministers, women-<lb/>
                    <pb n="118"/> whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for<lb/> church
                    members. The man who wields the blood-<lb/> clotted cowskin during the week
                    fills the pulpit on<lb/> Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek
                    and<lb/> lowly Jesus. The man who robs me of my earnings<lb/> at the end of each
                    week meets me as a class-leader<lb/> on Sunday morning, to show me the way of
                    life,<lb/> and the path of salvation. He who sells my sister,<lb/> for purposes
                    of prostitution, stands forth as the pi-<lb/> ous advocate of purity. He who
                    proclaims it a re-<lb/> ligious duty to read the Bible denies me the right<lb/>
                    of learning to read the name of the God who made<lb/> me. He who is the
                    religious advocate of marriage<lb/> robs whole millions of its sacred influence,
                    and leaves<lb/> them to the ravages of wholesale pollution. The<lb/> warm
                    defender of the sacredness of the family re-<lb/> lation is the same that
                    scatters whole families,â€” sun-<lb/> dering husbands and wives, parents
                    and children,<lb/> sisters and brothers,â€” leaving the hut vacant, and
                    the<lb/> hearth desolate. We see the thief preaching against<lb/> theft, and the
                    adulterer against adultery. We have<lb/> men sold to build churches, women sold
                    to support<lb/> the gospel, and babes sold to purchase Bibles for<lb/> the POOR
                    HEATHEN! ALL FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AND THE<lb/> GOOD OF SOULS! The slave
                    auctioneer's bell and the<lb/> church-going bell chime in with each other, and
                    the<lb/> bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned<lb/> in the
                    religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals<lb/> of religion and revivals in
                    the slave-trade go hand<lb/> in hand together. The slave prison and the
                    church<lb/> stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and<lb/> the rattling
                    of chains in the prison, and the pious<lb/> psalm and solemn prayer in the
                    church, may be<lb/> heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies<lb/> and
                    souls of men erect their stand in the presence<lb/> of the pulpit, and they
                    mutually help each other.<lb/> The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support<lb/>
                    <pb n="119"/> the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his in-<lb/> fernal
                    business with the garb of Christianity. Here<lb/> we have religion and robbery
                    the allies of each other<lb/>â€” devils dressed in angels' robes, and hell
                    presenting<lb/> the semblance of paradise.<lb/>
                    <lb/> "Just God! and these are they,<lb/> Who minister at thine altar, God of
                    right!<lb/> Men who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay<lb/> On Israel's
                    ark of light.<lb/>
                    <lb/> "What! preach, and kidnap men?<lb/> Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted
                    poor?<lb/> Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then<lb/> Bolt hard the captive's door?<lb/>
                    <lb/> "What! servants of thy own<lb/> Merciful Son, who came to seek and
                    save<lb/> The homeless and the outcast, fettering down<lb/> The tasked and
                    plundered slave!<lb/>
                    <lb/> "Pilate and Herod friends!<lb/> Chief priests and rulers, as of old,
                    combine!<lb/> Just God and holy! is that church which lends<lb/> Strength to the
                    spoiler thine?"<lb/>
                    <lb/>
                </p>
                <p>The Christianity of America is a Christianity, of<lb/> whose votaries it may be
                    as truly said, as it was of<lb/> the ancient scribes and Pharisees, "They bind
                    heavy<lb/> burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on<lb/> men's
                    shoulders, but they themselves will not move<lb/> them with one of their
                    fingers. All their works they<lb/> do for to be seen of men.â€” They love
                    the upper-<lb/> most rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the syna-<lb/>
                    gogues, . . . . . . and to be called of men, Rabbi,<lb/> Rabbi.â€” But woe
                    unto you, scribes and Pharisees,<lb/> hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven<lb/>
                    <pb n="120"/> against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither<lb/> suffer
                    ye them that are entering to go in. Ye devour<lb/> widows' houses, and for a
                    pretence make long<lb/> prayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater
                    dam-<lb/> nation. Ye compass sea and land to make one prose-<lb/> lyte, and when
                    he is made, ye make him twofold<lb/> more the child of hell than yourselves.
                   â€” Woe unto<lb/> you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay<lb/>
                    tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omit-<lb/> ted the weightier
                    matters of the law, judgment,<lb/> mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have
                    done, and<lb/> not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides!<lb/> which strain
                    at a gnat, and swallow a camel. Woe<lb/> unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
                    hypocrites! for ye<lb/> make clean the outside of the cup and of the
                    platter;<lb/> but within, they are full of extortion and excess.â€”<lb/>
                    Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for<lb/> ye are like unto
                    whited sepulchres, which indeed ap-<lb/> pear beautiful outward, but are within
                    full of dead<lb/> men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also<lb/>
                    outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within<lb/> ye are full of hypocrisy
                    and iniquity."<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Dark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be<lb/> strictly true of the
                    overwhelming mass of professed<lb/> Christians in America. They strain at a
                    gnat, and<lb/> swallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of<lb/> our
                    churches? They would be shocked at the propo-<lb/> sition of fellowshipping a
                    SHEEP-stealer; and at the<lb/> same time they hug to their communion a MAN-<lb/>
                    stealer, and brand me with being an infidel, if I<lb/> find fault with them for
                    it. They attend with Phari-<lb/> saical strictness to the outward forms of
                    religion, and<lb/> at the same time neglect the weightier matters of<lb/> the
                    law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are al-<lb/> ways ready to sacrifice, but
                    seldom to show mercy.<lb/> They are they who are represented as professing to<lb/>
                    <pb n="121"/> love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate<lb/> their
                    brother whom they have seen. They love the<lb/> heathen on the other side of the
                    globe. They can<lb/> pray for him, pay money to have the Bible put into<lb/> his
                    hand, and missionaries to instruct him; while<lb/> they despise and totally
                    neglect the heathen at their<lb/> own doors.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>Such is, very briefly, my view of the religion of<lb/> this land; and to avoid
                    any misunderstanding, grow-<lb/> ing out of the use of general terms, I mean by
                    the<lb/> religion of this land, that which is revealed in the<lb/> words, deeds,
                    and actions, of those bodies, north and<lb/> south, calling themselves Christian
                    churches, and yet<lb/> in union with slaveholders. It is against religion,
                    as<lb/> presented by these bodies, that I have felt it my<lb/> duty to
                    testify.<lb/>
                </p>
                <p>I conclude these remarks by copying the following<lb/> portrait of the religion
                    of the south, (which is, by<lb/> communion and fellowship, the religion of
                    the<lb/> north,) which I soberly affirm is "true to the life,"<lb/> and without
                    caricature or the slightest exaggeration.<lb/> It is said to have been drawn,
                    several years before<lb/> the present anti-slavery agitation began, by a
                    north-<lb/> ern Methodist preacher, who, while residing at the<lb/> south, had
                    an opportunity to see slaveholding mor-<lb/> als, manners, and piety, with his
                    own eyes. "Shall<lb/> I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Shall
                    not<lb/> my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?"</p>

                <p>Sincerely and earnestly hoping that this little book<lb/> may do something toward
                    throwing light on the<lb/> American slave system, and hastening the glad
                    day<lb/> of deliverance to the millions of my brethren in<lb/> bondsâ€”
                    faithfully relying upon the power of truth,<lb/> love, and justice, for success
                    in my humble efforts<lb/>â€” and solemnly pledging my self anew to the
                    sacred<lb/> cause,â€” I subscribe myself,<lb/>
