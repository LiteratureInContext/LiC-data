                        premiered in February of 1780 at Covent Garden, in London, with the cast

                     <note><p>Project Gutenberg Transcriber's Note: Hyphenation in inconsistent
                           throughout; missing punctuation and occasional missing spaces have been
                           added. The errata have been incorporated. The spelling of character names
                           has been harmonised. Overall, contemporary spellings have been retained;
                           however, a small number of words have been modernised to prevent
                           misunderstanding. One instance of "genus" was left unchanged, since it
                           may well serve a purpose in furthering the characterisation. A section of
                           publisher's advertising at the end was illegible and has been omitted.
                           One instance of double typesetting (same word at end of one line and the
                           beginning of the next) was corrected. </p><p> Although there is
                           occasional reference in the stage directions to "(the) Miss Ogles" it is
                           clear from the context that the name is "Ogle" and only one character of
                           that name is present, so the name was changed accordingly.</p><p>At the
                           end of the scene at Sir George's in Act 2, Mrs Racket exits twice in
                           short order; this reflects the original. Three substantive changes were

               <p>In the following Comedy, my purpose was, to draw a FEMALE CHARACTER, which with
                  the most lively Sensibility, fine Understanding, and elegant Accomplishments,
                  should unite that beautiful Reserve and Delicacy which, whilst they veil those
                  charms, render them still more interesting. In delineating such a Character, my
                  heart naturally dedicated it to YOUR MAJESTY; and nothing remained, but permission
                  to lay it at Your feet. Your Majesty's graciously allowing me this high Honour, is
                  the point to which my hopes aspired, and a reward, of which without censure I may
                  be proud.</p>

                           once, like hounds on a fresh scent:—"Oh, cousin Courtall!—How do you do,
                           cousin Courtall! Lord, cousin, I am glad you are come! We want you to go

                           am sure I won't.—However, I heroically stayed an hour with them, and

                        Why, I have had a Baronet's for five shillings, though he was a married man,
                        and changed his mistress every six weeks.</l>

                        French fellows and Germans, as the Romans kept slaves; because their own
                        countrymen had minds too enlarged and haughty to descend with a grace to the

                     <l> On my honour, experience will convince you of its truth. A Frenchman
                        neither hears, sees, nor breathes, but as his master directs; and his whole
                        system of conduct is compris'd in one short word, <hi rend="italic"
                           >Obedience</hi>! An Englishman reasons, forms opinions, cogitates, and
                        disputes; he is the mere creature of your will: the other, a being,
                        conscious of equal importance in the universal scale with yourself, and is
                        therefore your judge, whilst he wears your livery, and decides on your

                        wise at eighteen. But consider this point: we go into Italy, where the sole
                        business of the people is to study and improve the powers of Music: we yield
                        to the fascination, and grow enthusiasts in the charming science: we travel
                        over France, and see the whole kingdom composing ornaments, and inventing
                        Fashions: we condescend to avail ourselves of their industry, and adopt
                        their modes: we return to England, and find the nation intent on the most
                        important objects; Polity, Commerce, War, with all the Liberal Arts, employ
                        her sons; the latent sparks glow afresh within our bosoms; the sweet follies
                        of the Continent imperceptibly slide away, whilst Senators, Statesmen,
                        Patriots and Heroes, emerge from the <hi rend="italic">virtû</hi> of Italy,
                        and the frippery of France.</l>

                     <l> Faith, neither one nor t'other; she's a fine girl, as far as mere flesh and

                     <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                     <l> Why, she's <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a fine girl; complexion, shape, and
                        features; nothing more.</l>
                  </sp>

                     <l>No! she should have spirit! fire! <hi rend="italic">l'air enjoué!</hi> that
                        something, that nothing, which every body feels, and which no body can
                        describe, in the resistless charmers of Italy and France.</l>

                     <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                     <l> Thanks to the parsimony of my father, that kept me from travel! I would not
                        have lost my relish for true unaffected English beauty, to have been
                        quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Versailles and Florence.</l>

                     <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                     <l> Pho! thou hast no taste. <hi rend="italic">English</hi> beauty! 'Tis
                        insipidity; it wants the zest, it wants poignancy, Frank! Why, I have known
                        a Frenchwoman, indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent
                        eyes, reckon in her suite as many Counts, Marquisses, and <hi rend="italic"
                           >Petits Maîtres</hi>, as would satisfy three dozen of our first-rate
                        toasts. I have known an Italian <hi rend="italic">Marquizina</hi> make ten
                        conquests in stepping from her carriage, and carry her slaves from one city
                        to another, whose real intrinsic beauty would have yielded to half the
                        little <hi rend="italic">Grisettes</hi> that pace your Mall on a Sunday.</l>

                     <l> And has Miss Hardy nothing of this?</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                     <l> If she has, she was pleased to keep it to herself. I was in the room half
                        an hour before I could catch the colour of her eyes; and every attempt to
                        draw her into conversation occasioned so cruel an embarrassment, that I was
                        reduced to the necessity of news, French fleets, and Spanish captures, with
                        her father.</l>

                     <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                     <l> So Miss Hardy, with only beauty, modesty, and merit, is doom'd to the arms
                        of a husband who will despise her.</l>

                     <speaker>Doric.</speaker>
                     <l> You are unjust. Though she has not inspir'd me with violent passion, my
                        honour secures her felicity.</l>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                     <l> Come, come, Doricourt, you know very well that when the honour of a husband
                        is <hi rend="italic">locum-tenens</hi> for his heart, his wife must be as
                        indifferent as himself, if she is not unhappy.</l>

                     <l> Pho! never moralise without spectacles. But, as we are upon the tender
                        subject, how did you bear Touchwood's carrying Lady Frances?</l>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                     <l> You know I never look'd up to her with hope, and Sir George is every way
                        worthy of her.</l>

                        the evening: but breakfast with me to-morrow, and we'll talk of our old
                        companions; for I swear to you, Saville, the air of the Continent has not
                        effaced one youthful prejudice or attachment.</l>

                        poor conquest, I have proved that all those imputed charms amount to
                        nothing;—for Doricourt saw them unmov'd.—A husband of fifteen months could
                        not have examined me with more cutting indifference.</l>

                        It is the same face that my memory, and my dreams, constantly painted to me;
                        but its graces are finished, and every beauty heightened. How mortifying, to
                        feel myself at the same moment his slave, and an object of perfect

                        boarding-school? He is the prettiest fellow you have seen, and in course
                        bewilders your imagination; but he has seen a million of pretty women,
                        child, before he saw you; and his first feelings have been over long
                        ago.</l>

                        because she's over head and ears in love with him; all which, it seems, your

                     <l> Well, come, do you tell me what's the matter then? If you don't like him,
                        hang the signing and sealing, he sha'n't have ye:—and yet I can't say that
                        neither; for you know that estate, that cost his father and me upwards of
                        fourscore thousand pounds, must go all to him if you won't have him: if he
                        won't have you, indeed, 'twill be all yours. All that's clear, engross'd
                        upon parchment, and the poor dear man set his hand to it whilst he was a
                        dying.—"Ah!" said I, "I foresee you'll never live to see 'em come together;
                        but their first son shall be christened Jeremiah after you, that I promise
                        you."——But come, I say, what is the matter? Don't you like him?</l>

                        vastly. Don't you think he must have taken a fancy to her?</l>

                     <l> It is not my toilette that can serve me: but a plan has struck me, if you
                        will not oppose it, which flatters me with brilliant success.</l>

                     <speaker>Letit.</speaker>
                     <l> Why, Sir—it may seem a little paradoxical; but, as he does not like me
                        enough, I want him to like me still less, and will at our next interview
                        endeavour to heighten his indifference into dislike.</l>

                        transform indifference into tender passion.</l>

                        and on this hazard willingly stake my chance for happiness. I am impatient

                        where——but I shall be at home time enough to witness this extraordinary

                        agreeable fellow, and ten years younger than I am; and the women, I observe,
                        always simper when you appear. For these reasons, I had rather, when Lady
                        Frances and I are together, that you should forget we are acquainted,
                        further than a nod, a smile, or a how-d'ye.</l>

                        the fashion than it is; and it is already so much so, that my doors are of
                        no use to me. I married Lady Frances to engross her to myself; yet such is
                        the blessed freedom of modern manners, that, in spite of me, her eyes,
                        thoughts, and conversation, are continually divided amongst all the Flirts
                        and Coxcombs of Fashion.</l>

                        Pantheons, Operas, and Robes de Cour, would have swallowed his Sea-Weeds,
                        Moths, and Monsters, in six weeks!—Sir George, I find, thinks his Wife a

                        you should have stay'd in the country;—'tis an Exhibition not calculated for
                        London, I assure you!</l>

                        as linsey-woolsey, or a black bonnet at the <hi rend="italic"

                     <l>A being easily described, Madam, as she is seen every where, but in her own
                        house. She sleeps at home, but she lives all over the town. In her mind,
                        every sentiment gives place to the Lust of Conquest, and the vanity of being
                        particular. The feelings of Wife, and Mother, are lost in the whirl of
                        dissipation. If she continues virtuous, 'tis by chance—and if she preserves
                        her Husband from ruin, 'tis by her dexterity at the Card-Table!—Such a Woman
                        I take to be a perfect Fine Lady!</l>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>And you I take to be a slanderous Cynic of two-and-thirty.—Twenty years
                        hence, one might have forgiven such a libel!—Now, Sir, hear my definition of
                        a Fine Lady:—She is a creature for whom Nature has done much, and Education
                        more; she has Taste, Elegance, Spirit, Understanding. In her manner she is
                        free, in her morals nice. Her behaviour is undistinguishingly polite to her
                        Husband, and all mankind;—her sentiments are for their hours of retirement.
                        In a word, a Fine Lady is the life of conversation, the spirit of society,
                        the joy of the public!—Pleasure follows where ever she appears, and the
                        kindest wishes attend her slumbers.—Make haste, then, my dear Lady Frances,
                        commence Fine Lady, and force your Husband to acknowledge the justness of my
                        picture!</l>

                        painted Fashionable Life in colours so disgusting, that I thought I hated
                        it; but, on a nearer view, it seems charming. I have hitherto lived in
                        obscurity; 'tis time that I should be a Woman of the World. I long to
                        begin;—my heart pants with expectation and delight!</l>

                     <l>Will you go without me!—ha! ha! ha! what a pathetic address! Why, sure you
                        would not always be seen side by side, like two beans upon a stalk. Are you
                        afraid to trust Lady Frances with me, Sir?</l>

                     <l>Heaven and earth! with whom can a man trust his wife, in the present state
                        of society? Formerly there were distinctions of character amongst ye: every
                        class of females had its particular description; Grandmothers were pious,
                        Aunts, discreet, Old Maids censorious! but now aunts, grandmothers, girls,
                        and maiden gentlewomen, are all the same creature;—a wrinkle more or less is
                        the sole difference between ye.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>That Maiden Gentlewomen have lost their censoriousness, is surely not in
                        your catalogue of grievances.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                     <l>Indeed it is—and ranked amongst the most serious grievances.—Things went
                        well, Madam, when the tongues of three or four old Virgins kept all the
                        Wives and Daughters of a parish in awe. They were the Dragons that guarded
                        the Hesperian fruit; and I wonder they have not been oblig'd, by act of
                        parliament, to resume their function.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>Ha! ha! ha! and pension'd, I suppose, for making strict enquiries into the
                        lives and conversations of their neighbours.</l>

                     <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                     <l>With all my heart, and impowered to oblige every woman to conform her
                        conduct to her real situation. You, for instance, are a Widow: your air
                        should be sedate, your dress grave, your deportment matronly, and in all
                        things an example to the young women growing up about you!—instead of which,
                        you are dress'd for conquest, think of nothing but ensnaring hearts; are a
                        Coquette, a Wit, and a Fine Lady.</l>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>Bear witness to what he says! A Coquette! a Wit! and a Fine Lady! Who would
                        have expected an eulogy from such an ill-natur'd mortal!—Valour to a
                        Soldier, Wisdom to a Judge, or glory to a Prince, is not more than such a
                        character to a Woman.</l>

                     <l>Sir George, I see, languishes for the charming society of a century and a
                        half ago; when a grave 'Squire, and a still graver Dame, surrounded by a
                        sober family, form'd a stiff groupe in a mouldy old house in the corner of a
                        Park.</l>

                     <l>Delightful serenity! Undisturb'd by any noise but the cawing of rooks, and
                        the quarterly rumbling of an old family-coach on a state-visit; with the
                        happy intervention of a friendly call from the Parish Apothecary, or the
                        Curate's Wife.</l>

                     <speaker>Sir Geo.</speaker>
                     <l>And what is the society of which you boast?—a meer chaos, in which all
                        distinction of rank is lost in a ridiculous affectation of ease, and every
                        different order of beings huddled together, as they were before the
                        creation. In the same <hi rend="italic">select party</hi>, you will often
                        find the wife of a Bishop and a Sharper, of an Earl and a Fidler. In short,

                        manners.</l>

                     <l>I was yesterday at Mrs. Bloomer's. She was dress'd all in green; no other

                        neither feelings nor opinions of your own; but, like a glass in a tavern,
                        bear about those of every Blockhead, who gives you his;—and, because you <hi

                        in Lord Fillagree's sale, I shall discharge you.—You want a knack terribly:

                     <l>Very true, Mr. Silvertongue; but I can't dress like a Lady upon Half-a-crown
                        a day, as the saying is.—If you want me to dress like a Lady, you must

                     <l>——<hi rend="italic">Five Shillings</hi> a day! what a demand! Why, Woman,
                        there are a thousand Parsons in the town, who don't make Five Shillings a
                        day; though they preach, pray, christen, marry, and bury, for the Good of
                        the Community.—Five Shillings a day!—why, 'tis the pay of a Lieutenant in a
                        marching Regiment, who keeps a Servant, a Mistress, a Horse; fights,
                        dresses, ogles, makes love, and dies upon Five Shillings a day.</l>

                     <l>Oh, as to that, all that's very right. A Soldier should not be too fond of
                        life; and forcing him to do all these things upon Five Shillings a day, is
                        the readiest way to make him tir'd on't.</l>

                        am going there directly. You know his Picture-Sale comes on to-day; and I
                        have got my head full of Parmegiano, Sal Rosa, Metzu, Tarbaek, and
                        Vandermeer. I talk of the relief of Woovermans, the spirit of Teniers, the
                        colouring of the Venetian School, and the correctness of the Roman. I
                        distinguish Claude by his Sleep, and Ruysdael by his Water. The rapidity of
                        Tintoret's pencil strikes me at the first glance; whilst the harmony of
                        Vandyk, and the glow of Correggio, point out their Masters.</l>

                        their Neighbours Reputations. This elegant Mansion on the left, decorated

                        Work-House. Here's a Church—we'll pass over that, the doors are shut. The
                        Parsonage-house comes next;—we'll take a peep here, however.—Look at the

                     <speaker>Mrs. Racket.</speaker>

                     <l>My Lover!—Confess now that my absence at dinner was a severe mortification
                        to him.</l>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>I can't absolutely swear it spoilt his appetite; he eat as if he was hungry,
                        and drank his wine as though he liked it.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Letit.</speaker>
                     <l>What was the apology?</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>That you were ill;—but I gave him a hint, that your extreme bashfulness
                        could not support his eye.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Letit.</speaker>
                     <l>If I comprehend him, aukwardness and bashfulness are the last faults he can
                        pardon in a woman; so expect to see me transform'd into the veriest
                        maukin.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>You persevere then?</l>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Letit.</speaker>
                     <l>Certainly. I know the design is a rash one, and the event important;—it
                        either makes Doricourt mine by all the tenderest ties of passion, or
                        deprives me of him for ever; and never to be his wife will afflict me less,
                        than to be his wife and not be belov'd.</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Rack.</speaker>
                     <l>So you wo'n't trust to the good old maxim—"Marry first, and love will
                        follow?"</l>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Letit.</speaker>
                     <l>As readily as I would venture my last guinea, that good fortune might
                        follow. The woman that has not touch'd the heart of a man before he leads
                        her to the altar, has scarcely a chance to charm it when possession and
                        security turn their powerful arms against her.—But here he comes.—I'll
                        disappear for a moment.—Don't spare me.</l>

                        what spiteful things would be said of us.—At Kensington to-day a Lady met
                        us, whom we saw at Court, when we were presented; she lifted up her hands in
                        amazement!——Bless me! said she to her companion, here's Lady Francis without
                        Sir Hurlo Thrumbo!—My dear Mrs. Racket, consider what an important charge
                        you have! for Heaven's sake take her home again, or some Enchanter on a
                        flying Dragon will descend and carry her off.—Oh, said another, I dare say
                        Lady Frances has a clue at her heel, like the peerless Rosamond:—her tender

                        her, whose reputation cannot be hurt.—You shall know the result to-morrow.

                     <l>Oh, there can be no doubt of it. Flutter told us the whole history. Some
                        Italian Princess gave him a drug, in a box of sweetmeats, sent to him by her
                        own page; and it renders him lunatic every month. Poor Miss Hardy! I never
                        felt so much on any occasion in my life.</l>

                        the Masquerade, and charmed him in disguise—He professed the most violent
                        passion for her; and a plan was laid, this evening, to cheat him into

                        Miss Hardy, ha! ha! ha!—I'll carry him the intelligence directly.

                     <l>Your having preserved Lady Frances, in so imminent a danger. Start not,
                        Saville; to protect Lady Frances, was my right. You have wrested from me my

                     <l>I have a Sister, Saville, who is amiable; and you are worthy of her. I shail
                        give her a commission to steal your heart, out of revenge for what you have
                        done.</l>

                     <l>I cannot listen to a sentence which begins with so unpromising a word. You
                        must go with us into Hampshire; and, if you see each other with the eyes I
                        do, your felicity will be complete. I know no one, to whose heart I would so
                        readily commit the care of my Sister's happiness.</l>

                        retirement. Society has claims on Lady Frances, that forbid it.</l>

                     <speaker>Sav.</speaker>
                     <l>Yes, claims; Lady Frances was born to be the ornament of Courts. She is
                        sufficiently alarmed, not to wander beyond the reach of her Protector;—and,
                        from the British Court, the most tenderly-anxious Husband could not wish to
                        banish his Wife. Bid her keep in her eye the bright Example who presides
                        there; the splendour of whose rank yields to the superior lustre of her
                        Virtue.</l>
