<l>My mother taught me underneath a tree,

<l>"And we are put on earth a little space,
</l><l>That we may learn to bear the beams of love;
</l><l>And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
</l><l>Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

<lg type="stanza">
<l>"For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,

</l><l>And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.'"
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;

<l>I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear
</l><l>To lean in joy upon our father's knee;

<head>The Chimney Sweeper</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>When my mother died I was very young,
</l><l>And my father sold me while yet my tongue
</l><l>Could scarcely cry "'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"
</l><l>So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
</l><l>That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said
</l><l>"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare
</l><l>You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>And so he was quiet &amp; that very night,
</l><l>As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a  sight!
</l><l>That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned &amp; jack,
</l><l>Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
</l><l>And he open'd the coffins &amp; set them all free;
</l><l>Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run,
</l><l>And wash in a river, and shine in the Sun.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,
</l><l>They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind;
</l><l>And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
</l><l>He'd have God for his father &amp; never want joy.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark,
</l><l>And got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.
</l><l>Tho' the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm;
</l><l>So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.

<l>I love to rise in a summer morn
</l><l>When the birds sing on every tree;
</l><l>The distant huntsman winds his horn,
</l><l>And the sky-lark sings with me.
</l><l>O! what sweet company.

<l>But to go to school in a summer morn,
</l><l>O! it drives all joy away;

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Under a cruel eye outworn,
</l><l>The little ones spend the day
</l><l>In sighing and dismay.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah! then at times I drooping sit,
</l><l>And spend many an anxious hour,
</l><l>Nor in my book can I take delight,
</l><l>Nor sit in learning's bower,
</l><l>Worn thro'with the dreary shower.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>How can the bird that is born for joy
</l><l>Sit in a cage and sing?
</l><l>How can a child, when fears annoy,

</l><l>And forget his youthful spring?
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>O! father &amp; mother, if buds are nip'd
</l><l>And blossoms blown away,
</l><l>And if the tender plants are strip'd
</l><l>Of their joy in the springing day,
</l><l>By sorrow and care's dismay,

<l>How shall the summer arise in joy,
</l><l>Or the summer fruits appear?

<l>Youth of delight, come hither,

</l><l>Dark disputes &amp; artful teazing.
</l><l>Folly is an endless maze,
</l><l>Tangled roots perplex her ways.
</l><l>How many have fallen there!
</l><l>They stumble all night over bones of the dead,
</l><l>And feel they know not what but care,
</l><l>And wish to lead others, when they should be led.
