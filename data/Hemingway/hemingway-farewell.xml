            <head>CHAPTER 1</head>
            <p>In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across
                the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles
                and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving
                and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust
                they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty
                and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road
                and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers
                marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.</p>
            <p>The plain was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruit trees and beyond the
                plain the mountains were brown and bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at
                night we could see the flashes from the artillery. In the dark it was like summer
                lightning, but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling of a storm
                coming.</p>
            <p>Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching under the window and guns going
                past pulled by motortractors. There was much traffic at night and many mules on the
                roads with boxes of ammunition on each side of their pack-saddles and gray
                motor-trucks that carried men, and other trucks with loads covered with canvas that
                moved slower in the traffic. There were big guns too that passed in the day drawn by
                tractors, the long barrels of the guns covered with green branches and green leafy
                branches and vines laid over the tractors. To the north we could look across a
                valley and see <pb n="4"/> a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another mountain
                on this side of the river. There was fighting for that mountain too, but it was not
                successful, and in the fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the
                chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks black with rain. The
                vineyards were thin and bare-branched too and all the country wet and brown and dead
                with the autumn. There were mists over the river and clouds on the mountain and the
                trucks splashed mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet in their capes;
                their rifles were wet and under their capes the two leather cartridge-boxes on the
                front of the belts, gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of clips of thin, long
                6.5 mm. cartridges, bulged forward under the capes so that the men, passing on the
                road, marched as though they were six months gone with child.</p>
            <p>There were small gray motor-cars that passed going very fast; usually there was an
                officer on the seat with the driver and more officers in the back seat. They
                splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of the officers in the back was
                very small and sitting between two generals, he himself so small that you could not
                see his face but only the top of his cap and his narrow back, and if the car went
                especially fast it was probably the King. He lived in Udine and came out in this way
                nearly every day to see how things were going, and things went very badly.</p>
            <p>At the start of the winter came the permanent rain and with the rain came the
                cholera. But it was checked and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the
                army.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER II</head>
            <p>The next year there were many victories. The mountain that was beyond the valley and
                the hillside where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there were victories
                beyond the plain on the plateau to the south and we crossed the river in August and
                lived in a house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick shady trees in a
                walled garden and a wistaria vine purple on the side of the house. Now the fighting
                was in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away. The town was very nice and
                our house was very fine. The river ran behind us and the town had been captured very
                handsomely but the mountains beyond it could not be taken and I was very glad the
                Austrians seemed to want to come back to the town some time, if the war should end,
                because they did not bombard it to destroy it but only a little in a military way.
                People lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and artillery up side
                streets and two bawdy houses, one for troops and one for officers, and with the end
                of the summer, the cool nights, the fighting in the mountains beyond the town, the
                shell-marked iron of the railway bridge, the smashed tunnel by the river where the
                fighting had been, the trees around the square and the long avenue of trees that led
                to the square; these with there being girls in the town, the King passing in his
                motor car, sometimes now seeing his face and little long necked body and gray beard
                like a goat’s chin tuft; all these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost
                a wall through shelling, with plaster and rubble in their gardens and sometimes in
                the street, and the whole thing <pb n="6"/> going well on the Carso made the fall
                very different from the last fall when we had been in the country. The war was
                changed too.</p>
            <p>The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the town was gone. The forest had been
                green in the summer when we had come into the town but now there were the stumps and
                the broken trunks and the ground torn up, and one day at the end of the fall when I
                was out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud coming over the mountain. It
                came very fast and the sun went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and the
                sky was covered and the cloud came on down the mountain and suddenly we were in it
                and it was snow. The snow slanted across the wind, the bare ground was covered, the
                stumps of trees projected, there was snow on the guns and there were paths in the
                snow going back to the latrines behind trenches.</p>
            <p>Later, below in the town, I watched the snow falling, looking out of the window of
                the bawdy house, the house for officers, where I sat with a friend and two glasses
                drinking a bottle of Asti, and, looking out at the snow falling slowly and heavily,
                we knew it was all over for that year. Up the river the mountains had not been
                taken; none of the mountains beyond the river had been taken. That was all left for
                next year. My friend saw the priest from our mess going by in the street, walking
                carefully in the slush, and pounded on the window to attract his attention. The
                priest looked up. He saw us and smiled. My friend motioned for him to come in. The
                priest shook his head and went on. That night in the mess after the spaghetti
                course, which every one ate very quickly and seriously, lifting the spaghetti on the
                fork until the loose strands hung clear then lowering it into the mouth, or else
                using a continuous
                <pb n="7"/> lift and sucking into the mouth, helping ourselves to wine from the
                grass-covered gallon flask; it swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of
                the flask down with the forefinger and the wine, clear red, tannic and lovely,
                poured out into the glass held with the same hand; after this course, the captain
                commenced picking on the priest.</p>
            <p>The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a uniform like the rest of us but
                with a cross in dark red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray tunic. The
                captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubtful benefit, in order that I might
                understand perfectly, that nothing should be lost.</p>
            <p>“Priest to-day with girls,” the captain said looking at the priest and at me. The
                priest smiled and blushed and shook his head. This captain baited him often.</p>
            <p>“Not true?” asked the captain. “To-day I see priest with girls.”</p>
            <p>“No,” said the priest. The other officers were amused at the baiting.</p>
            <p>“Priest not with girls,” went on the captain. “Priest never with girls,” he explained
                to me. He took my glass and filled it, looking at my eyes all the time, but not
                losing sight of the priest.</p>
            <p>“Priest every night five against one.” Every one at the table laughed. “You
                understand? Priest every night five against one.” He made a gesture and laughed
                loudly. The priest accepted it as a joke.</p>
            <p>“The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war,” the major said. “He loves Franz
                Joseph. That’s where the money comes from. I am an atheist.”</p>
            <p>“Did you ever read the ‘Black Pig’ ?” asked the lieutenant. “I will get you a copy.
                It was that which shook my faith.”</p>

            <pb n="8"/>

            <p>“It is a filthy and vile book,” said the priest. “You do not really like it.”</p>
            <p>“It is very valuable,” said the lieutenant. “It tells you about those priests. You
                will like it,” he said to me. I smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the
                candlelight. “Don’t you read it,” he said.</p>
            <p>“I will get it for you,” said the lieutenant.</p>
            <p>“All thinking men are atheists,” the major said. “I do not believe in the Free Masons
                however.”</p>
            <p>“I believe in the Free Masons,” the lieutenant said. “It is a noble organization.”
                Some one came in and as the door opened I could see the snow falling.</p>
            <p>“There will be no more offensive now that the snow has come,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Certainly not,” said the major. “You should go on leave. You should go to Rome,
                Naples, Sicily----”</p>
            <p>“He should visit Amalfi,” said the lieutenant. “I will write you cards to my family
                in Amalfi. They will love you like a son.”</p>
            <p>“He should go to Palermo.”</p>
            <p>“He ought to go to Capri.”</p>
            <p>“I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family at Capracotta,” said the
                priest.</p>
            <p>“Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi. There’s more snow there than here. He doesn’t
                want to see peasants. Let him go to centres of culture and civilization.”</p>
            <p>He should have fine girls. I will give you the addresses of places in Naples.
                Beautiful young girls—accompanied by their mothers. Ha! Ha! Ha!” The captain spread
                his hand open, the thumb up and fingers outspread as when you make shadow pictures.
                There was a shadow from his hand on the wall. He spoke again in pidgin Italian. “You
                go away like this,” he <pb n="9"/> pointed to the thumb, “and come back like this,”
                he touched the little finger. Every one laughed.</p>
            <p>“Look,” said the captain. He spread the hand again. Again the candle-light made its
                shadows on the wall. He started with the upright thumb and named in their order the
                thumb and four fingers, “soto-tenente (the thumb), tenente (first finger), capitano
                (next finger), maggiore (next to the little finger), and tenente-colo-nello (the
                little finger). You go away soto-tenente! You come back soto-colonello!” They all
                laughed. The captain was having a great success with finger games. He looked at the
                priest and shouted, “Every night priest five against one!” They all laughed
                again.</p>
            <p>“You must go on leave at once,” the major said.</p>
            <p>“I would like to go with you and show you things,” the lieutenant said.</p>
            <p>“When you come back bring a phonograph.”</p>
            <p>“Bring good opera disks.”</p>
            <p>“Bring Caruso.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t bring Caruso. He bellows.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t you wish you could bellow like him?”</p>
            <p>“He bellows. I say he bellows!”</p>
            <p>“I would like you to go to Abruzzi,” the priest said. The others were shouting.
                “There is good hunting. You would like the people and though it is cold it is clear
                and dry. You could stay with my family. My father is a famous hunter.”</p>
            <p>“Come on,” said the captain. “We go whorehouse before it shuts.”</p>
            <p>“Good night,” I said to the priest.</p>
            <p>“Good night,” he said.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER III</head>
            <p>When I came back to the front we still lived in that town. There were many more guns
                in the country around and the spring had come. The fields were green and there were
                small green shoots on the vines, the trees along the road had small leaves and a
                breeze came from the sea. I saw the town with the hill and the old castle above it
                in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond, brown mountains with a little green
                on their slopes. In the town there were more guns, there were some new hospitals,
                you met British men and sometimes women, on the street, and a few more houses had
                been hit by shell fire. It was warm and like the spring and I walked down the
                alleyway of trees, warmed from the sun on the wall, and found we still lived in the
                same house and that it all looked the same as when I had left it. The door was open,
                there was a soldier sitting on a bench outside in the sun, an ambulance was waiting
                by the side door and inside the door, as I went in, there was the smell of marble
                floors and hospital. It was all as I had left it except that now it was spring. I
                looked in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting at his desk, the window
                open and the sunlight coming into the room. He did not see me and I did not know
                whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and clean up. I decided to go on
                upstairs.</p>
            <p>The room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked out on the courtyard. The window
                was open, my bed was made up with blankets and my things hung on the wall, the gas
                mask in an oblong tin can, the steel helmet on the same peg. At the foot of the bed
                was my flat <pb n="11"/> trunk, and my winter boots, the leather shiny with oil,
                were on the trunk. My Austrian sniper’s rifle with its blued octagon barrel and the
                lovely dark walnut, cheek-fitted, <hi>schutzen</hi> stock, hung over the two beds.
                The telescope that fitted it was, I remembered, locked in the trunk. The lieutenant,
                Rinaldi, lay asleep on the other bed. He woke when he heard me in the room and sat
                up.</p>
            <p>“Ciaou!” he said. “What kind of time did you have?”</p>
            <p>“Magnificent.”</p>
            <p>We shook hands and he put his arm around my neck and kissed me.</p>
            <p>“Oughf,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You’re dirty,” he said. “You ought to wash. Where did you go and what did you do?
                Tell me everything at once.”</p>
            <p>“I went everywhere. Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Villa San Giovanni, Messina,
                Taormina----”</p>
            <p>“You talk like a time-table. Did you have any beautiful adventures?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“Where?”</p>
            <p>“Milano, Firenze, Roma, Napoli----”</p>
            <p>“That’s enough. Tell me really what was the best.” “In Milano.”</p>
            <p>“That was because it was first. Where did you meet her ? In the Cova? Where did you
                go? How did you feel? Tell me everything at once. Did you stay all night?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“That’s nothing. Here now we have beautiful girls. New girls never been to the front
                before.”</p>
            <p>“Wonderful.”</p>
            <pb n="12"/>
            <p>“You don’t believe me? We will go now this afternoon and see. And in the town we have
                beautiful English girls. I am now in love with Miss Barkley. I will take you to
                call. I will probably marry Miss Barkley.”</p>
            <p>“I have to get washed and report. Doesn’t anybody work now?”</p>
            <p>“Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, chilblains, jaundice, gonorrhea,
                self-inflicted wounds, pneumonia and hard and soft chancres. Every week some one
                gets wounded by rock fragments. There are a few real wounded. Next week the war
                starts again. Perhaps it starts again. They say so. Do you think I would do right to
                marry Miss Barkley—after the war of course?”</p>
            <p>“Absolutely,” I said and poured the basin full of water.</p>
            <p>“To-night you will tell me everything,” said Rinaldi. “Now I must go back to sleep to
                be fresh and beautiful for Miss Barkley.”</p>
            <p>I took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold water in the basin. While I
                rubbed myself with a towel I looked around the room and out the window and at
                Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed. He was good-looking, was my age, and
                he came from Amalfi. He loved being a surgeon and we were great friends. While I was
                looking at him he opened his eyes.</p>
            <p>“Have you any money ?&quot;</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“Loan me fifty lire.”</p>
            <p>I dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from the inside of my tunic hanging on
                the wall. Rinaldi took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and slid it
                in his breeches pocket. He smiled, “I must make <pb n="13"/> on Miss Barkley the
                impression of a man of sufficient wealth. You are my great and good friend and
                financial protector.”</p>
            <p>“Go to hell,” I said.</p>
            <p>That night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he was disappointed and suddenly
                hurt that I had not gone to the Abruzzi. He had written to his father that I was
                coming and they had made preparations. I myself felt as badly as he did and could
                not understand why I had not gone. It was what I had wanted to do and I tried to
                explain how one thing had led to another and finally he saw it and understood that I
                had really wanted to go and it was almost all right. I had drunk much wine and
                afterward coffee and Strega and I explained, wine-fully, how we did not do the
                things we wanted to do; we never did such things.</p>
            <p>We two were talking while the others argued. I had wanted to go to Abruzzi. I had
                gone to no place where the roads were frozen and hard as iron, where it was clear
                cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery and hare-tracks in the snow and the
                peasants took off their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunting. I had
                gone to no such place but to the smoke of cafes and nights when the room whirled and
                you needed to look at the wall to make it stop, nights in bed, drunk, when you knew
                that that was all there was, and the strange excitement of waking and not knowing
                who it was with you, and the world all unreal in the dark and so exciting that you
                must resume again unknowing and not caring in the night, sure that this was all and
                all and all and not caring. Suddenly to care very much and to sleep to wake with it
                sometimes morning and all that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard and
                clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost.</p>
            <pb n="14"/>
            <p>Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and breakfast and lunch. Sometimes all
                niceness gone and glad to get out on the street but always another day starting and
                then another night. I tried to tell about the night and the difference between the
                night and the day and how the night was better unless the day was very clean and
                cold and I could not tell it; as I cannot tell it now. But if you have had it you
                know. He had not had it but he understood that I had really wanted to go to the
                Abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends, with many tastes alike, but with
                the difference between us. He had always known what I did not know and what, when I
                learned it, I was always able to forget. But I did not know that then, although I
                learned it later. In the meantime we were all at the mess, the meal was finished,
                and the argument went on. We two stopped talking and the captain shouted, “Priest
                not happy. Priest not happy without girls.”</p>
            <p>“I am happy,” said the priest.</p>
            <p>‘‘Priest not happy. Priest wants Austrians to win the war,” the captain said. The
                others listened. The priest shook his head.</p>
            <p>“No,” he said.</p>
            <p>Priest wants us never to attack. Don’t you want us never to attack?”</p>
            <p>No. If there is a war I suppose we must attack.” “Must attack. Shall attack!”</p>
            <p>The priest nodded.</p>
            <p>Leave him alone,” the major said. “He’s all right.” He can t do anything about it
                anyway,” the captain said. We all got up and left the table.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
            <p>The battery in the next garden woke me in the morning and I saw the sun coming
                through the window and got out of the bed. I went to the window and looked out. The
                gravel paths were moist and the grass was wet with dew. The battery fired twice and
                the air came each time like a blow and shook the window and made the front of my
                pajamas flap. I could not see the guns but they were evidently firing directly over
                us. It was a nuisance to have them there but it was a comfort that they were no
                bigger. As I looked out at the garden I heard a motor truck starting on the road. I
                dressed, went downstairs, had some coffee in the kitchen and went out to the
                garage.</p>
            <p>Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long shed. They were top-heavy,
                blunt-nosed ambulances, painted gray and built like moving-vans. The mechanics were
                working on one out in the yard. Three others were up in the mountains at
                dressing-stations.</p>
            <p>“Do they ever shell that battery?” I asked one of the mechanics.</p>
            <p>“No, Signor Tenente. It is protected by the little hill.”</p>
            <p>“How’s everything?”</p>
            <p>“Not so bad. This machine is no good but the others march.” He stopped working and
                smiled. “Were you on permission?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned. “You have a good time?” The others all
                grinned too.</p>
            <pb n="16"/>
            <p>“Fine,” I said. “What’s the matter with this machine ?”</p>
            <p>“It’s no good. One thing after another.”</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter now ?”</p>
            <p>“New rings.”</p>
            <p>I left them working, the car looking disgraced and empty with the engine open and
                parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the
                cars. They were moderately clean, a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked
                at the tires carefully, looking for cuts or stone bruises. Everything seemed in good
                condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things
                or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were
                obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from
                the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station
                and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended to a
                considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or
                not.</p>
            <p>“Has there been any trouble getting parts?” I asked the sergeant mechanic.</p>
            <p>“No, Signor Tenente.”</p>
            <p>“Where is the gasoline park now?”</p>
            <p>“At the same place.”</p>
            <p>Good,” I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of coffee at the mess
                table. The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed milk. Outside the window
                it was a lovely spring morning. There was that beginning of a feeling of dryness in
                the nose that meant the day would be hot later on. That day I visited the posts in
                the mountains and was back in town late in the afternoon.</p>
            <pb n="17"/>
            <p>The whole thing seemed to run better while I was away. The offensive was going to
                start again I heard. The division for which we worked were to attack at a place up
                the river and the major told me that I would see about the posts for during the
                attack. The attack would cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread up the
                hillside. The posts for the cars would have to be as near the river as they could
                get and keep covered. They would, of course, be selected by the infantry but we were
                supposed to work it out. It was one of those things that gave you a false feeling of
                soldiering.</p>
            <p>I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash. Rinaldi was sitting on the
                bed with a copy of Hugo’s English grammar. He was dressed, wore his black boots, and
                his hair shone.</p>
            <p>“Splendid,” he said when he saw me. “You will come with me to see Miss Barkley.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. You will please come and make me a good impression on her.”</p>
            <p>“All right. Wait till I get cleaned up.”</p>
            <p>“Wash up and come as you are.”</p>
            <p>I washed, brushed my hair and we started.</p>
            <p>“Wait a minute,” Rinaldi said. “Perhaps we should have a drink.” He opened his trunk
                and took out a bottle.</p>
            <p>“Not Strega,” I said.</p>
            <p>“No. Grappa.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>He poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended. The grappa was
                very strong.</p>
            <p>“Another ?”</p>
            <p>“All right,” I said. We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the bottle and we
                went down the <pb n="18"/> stairs. It was hot walking through the town but the sun
                was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. The British hospital was a big
                villa built by Germans before the war. Miss Barkley was in the garden. Another nurse
                was with her. We saw their white uniforms through the trees and walked toward them.
                Rinaldi saluted. I saluted too but more moderately.</p>
            <p>“How do you do?” Miss Barkley said. “You’re not an Italian, are you ?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, no.”</p>
            <p>Rinaldi was talking with the other nurse. They were laughing.</p>
            <p>“What an odd thing—to be in the Italian army.” “It’s not really the army. It’s only
                the ambulance.” “It’s very odd though. Why did you do it?” “I don’t know,” I said.
                “There isn’t always an explanation for everything.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, isn’t there? I was brought up to think there was.”</p>
            <p>“That’s awfully nice.”</p>
            <p>“Do we have to go on and talk this way?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said.</p>
            <p>“That’s a relief. Isn’t it?”</p>
            <p>“What is the stick?” I asked. Miss Barkley was quite tall. She wore what seemed to me
                to be a nurse’s uniform, was blonde and had a tawny skin and gray eyes. I thought
                she was very beautiful. She was carrying a thin rattan stick like a toy riding-crop,
                bound in leather.</p>
            <p>It belonged to a boy who was killed last year.” “I’m awfully sorry.”</p>
            <p>He was a very nice boy. He was going to marry me and he was killed in the Somme.”</p>
            <p>“It was a ghastly show.”</p>
            <pb n="19"/>
            <p>“Were you there?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve heard about it,” she said. “There’s not really any war of that sort down here.
                They sent me the little stick. His mother sent it to me. They returned it with his
                things.”</p>
            <p>“Had you been engaged long ?”</p>
            <p>“Eight years. We grew up together.”</p>
            <p>“And why didn’t you marry ?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know,” she said. “I was a fool not to. I could have given him that anyway.
                But I thought it would be bad for him.”</p>
            <p>“I see.”</p>
            <p>“Have you ever loved any one ?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said.</p>
            <p>We sat down on a bench and I looked at her.</p>
            <p>“You have beautiful hair,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Do you like it ?”</p>
            <p>“Very much.”</p>
            <p>“I was going to cut it all off when he died.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“I wanted to do something for him. You see I didn’t care about the other thing and he
                could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I
                would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to
                go to war and I didn’t know.”</p>
            <p>I did not say anything.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t know about anything then. I thought it would be worse for him. I thought
                perhaps he couldn’t stand it and then of course he was killed and that was the end
                of it.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, yes,” she said. “That’s the end of it.”</p>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <p>We looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse.</p>
            <p>“What is her name?”</p>
            <p>“Ferguson. Helen Ferguson. Your friend is a doctor, isn’t he ?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. He’s very good.”</p>
            <p>“That’s splendid. You rarely find any one any good this close to the front. This is
                close to the front, isn’t it?”</p>
            <p>“Quite.”</p>
            <p>“It’s a silly front,” she said. “But it’s very beautiful. Are they going to have an
                offensive?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“Then we’ll have to work. There’s no work now.”</p>
            <p>“Have you done nursing long?”</p>
            <p>“Since the end of ’fifteen. I started when he did. I remember having a silly idea he
                might come to the hospital where I was. With a sabre cut, I suppose, and a bandage
                around his head. Or shot through the shoulder. Something picturesque.”</p>
            <p>“This is the picturesque front,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Yes,” she said. “People can’t realize what France is like. If they did, it couldn’t
                all go on. He didn’t have a sabre cut. They blew him all to bits.”</p>
            <p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
            <p>“Do you suppose it will always go on?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“What’s to stop it?”</p>
            <p>“It will crack somewhere.”</p>
            <p>We'll crack. We’ll crack in France. They can’t go on going things like the Somme and
                not crack.”</p>
            <p>“They won’t crack here,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You think not?”</p>
            <p>“No. They did very well last summer.”</p>
            <p>“They may crack,” she said. “Anybody may crack.”</p>
            <pb n="21"/>
            <p>“The Germans too.”</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. “I think not.”</p>
            <p>We went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson.</p>
            <p>“You love Italy?” Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in English.</p>
            <p>“Quite well.”</p>
            <p>“No understand,” Rinaldi shook his head.</p>
            <p>“Abbastanza bene,” I translated. He shook his head.</p>
            <p>“That is not good. You love England?”</p>
            <p>“Not too well. I’m Scotch, you see.”</p>
            <p>Rinaldi looked at me blankly.</p>
            <p>“She’s Scotch, so she loves Scotland better than England,” I said in Italian.</p>
            <p>“But Scotland is England.”</p>
            <p>I translated this for Miss Ferguson.</p>
            <p>“Pas encore,” said Miss Ferguson.</p>
            <p>“Not really?”</p>
            <p>“Never. We do not like the English.”</p>
            <p>“Not like the English? Not like Miss Barkley?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, that’s different. You mustn’t take everything so literally.”</p>
            <p>After a while we said good-night and left Walking home Rinaldi said, “Miss Barkley
                prefers you to me. That is very clear. But the little Scotch one is very nice.”</p>
            <p>“Very,” I said. I had not noticed her. “You like her?”</p>
            <p>“No,” said Rinaldi.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V</head>
            <p>The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley again. She was not in the garden
                and I went to the side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up. Inside I saw
                the head nurse, who said Miss Barkley was on duty—“there’s a war on, you know.”</p>
            <p>I said I knew.</p>
            <p>“You’re the American in the Italian army?” she asked.</p>
            <p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
            <p>“How did you happen to do that? Why didn’t you join up with us?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “Could I join now?”</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid not now. Tell me. Why did you join up with the Italians?”</p>
            <p>“I was in Italy,” I said, “and I spoke Italian.”</p>
            <p>“Oh,” she said. “I’m learning it. It’s a beautiful language.”</p>
            <p>“Somebody said you should be able to learn it in two weeks.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, I’ll not learn it in two weeks. I’ve studied it for months now. You may come and
                see her after seven o’clock if you wish. She’ll be off then. But don’t bring a lot
                of Italians.”</p>
            <p>“Not even for the beautiful language?”</p>
            <p>“No. Nor for the beautiful uniforms.”</p>
            <p>“Good evening,” I said.</p>
            <p>“A rivederci, Tenente.”</p>
            <p>“A rivederla.” I saluted and went out It was impossible to salute foreigners as an
                Italian, without embarrassment.
                <pb n="23"/> The Italian salute never seemed made for export.</p>
            <p>The day had been hot. I had been up the river to the bridgehead at Plava. It was
                there that the offensive was to begin. It had been impossible to advance on the far
                side the year before because there was only one road leading down from the pass to
                the pontoon bridge and it was under machine-gun and shell fire for nearly a mile. It
                was not wide enough either to carry all the transport for an offensive and the
                Austrians could make a shambles out of it. But the Italians had crossed and spread
                out a little way on the far side to hold about a mile and a half on the Austrian
                side of the river. It was a nasty place and the Austrians should not have let them
                hold it. I suppose it was mutual tolerance because the Austrians still kept a
                bridgehead further down the river. The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside
                only a few yards from the Italian lines. There had been a little town but it was all
                rubble. There was what was left of a railway station and a smashed permanent bridge
                that could not be repaired and used because it was in plain sight.</p>
            <p>I went along the narrow road down toward the river, left the car at the dressing
                station under the hill, crossed the pontoon bridge, which was protected by a
                shoulder of the mountain, and went through the trenches in the smashed-down town and
                along the edge of the slope. Everybody was in the dugouts. There were racks of
                rockets standing to be touched off to call for help from the artillery or to signal
                with if the telephone wires were cut. It was quiet, hot and dirty. I looked across
                the wire at the Austrian lines. Nobody was in sight. I had a drink with a captain
                that I knew in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge.</p>
            <pb n="24"/>
            <p>A new wide road was being finished that would go over the mountain and zig-zag down
                to the bridge. When this road was finished the offensive would start. It came down
                through the forest in sharp turns. The system was to bring everything down the new
                road and take the empty trucks, carts and loaded ambulances and all returning
                traffic up the old narrow road. The dressing station was on the Austrian side of the
                river under the edge of the hill and stretcher-bearers would bring the wounded back
                across the pontoon bridge. It would be the same when the offensive started. As far
                as I could make out the last mile or so of the new road where it started to level
                out would be able to be shelled steadily by the Austrians. It looked as though it
                might be a mess. But I found a place where the cars would be sheltered after they
                had passed that last bad-looking bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought
                across the pontoon bridge. I would have liked to drive over the new road but it was
                not yet finished. It looked wide and well made with a good grade and the turns
                looked very impressive where you could see them through openings in the forest on
                the mountain side. The cars would be all right with their good metal-to-metal brakes
                and anyway, coming down, they would not be loaded. I drove back up the narrow
                road.</p>
            <p>Two carabinieri held the car up. A shell had fallen and while we waited three others
                fell up the road. They were seventy-sevens and came with a whishing rush of air, a
                hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke that blew across the road. The
                carabinieri waved us to go on. Passing where the shells had landed I avoided the
                small broken places and smelled the high explosive and the smell of blasted clay and
                stone and freshly shattered flint. I drove back to Gorizia and our villa <pb n="25"
                /> and, as I said, went to call on Miss Barkley, who was on duty.</p>
            <p>At dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa where the British had their
                hospital. It was really very large and beautiful and there were fine trees in the
                grounds. Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in the garden. Miss Ferguson was with
                her. They seemed glad to see me and in a little while Miss Ferguson excused herself
                and went away.</p>
            <p>“I’ll leave you two,” she said. “You get along very well without me.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t go, Helen,” Miss Barkley said.</p>
            <p>“I’d really rather. I must write some letters.”</p>
            <p>“Good-night,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Good-night, Mr. Henry.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t write anything that will bother the censor.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t worry. I only write about what a beautiful place we live in and how brave the
                Italians are.”</p>
            <p>“That way you’ll be decorated.”</p>
            <p>“That will be nice. Good-night, Catherine.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll see you in a little while,” Miss Barkley said. Miss Ferguson walked away in the
                dark.</p>
            <p>“She’s nice,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Oh, yes, she’s very nice. She’s a nurse.”</p>
            <p>“Aren’t you a nurse?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, no. I’m something called a V. A. D. We work very hard but no one trusts us.”</p>
            <p>“Why not?”</p>
            <p>“They don’t trust us when there’s nothing going on. When there is really work they
                trust us.”</p>
            <p>“What is the difference ?”</p>
            <p>“A nurse is like a doctor. It takes a long time to be. A V. A. D. is a short
                cut.”</p>
            <p>“I see.”</p>
            <pb n="26"/>
            <p>“The Italians didn’t want women so near the front So we’re all on very special
                behavior. We don’t go out”</p>
            <p>“I can come here though.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, yes. We’re not cloistered.”</p>
            <p>“Let’s drop the war.”</p>
            <p>“It’s very hard. There’s no place to drop it”</p>
            <p>“Let’s drop it anyway.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>We looked at each other in the dark. I thought she was very beautiful and I took her
                hand. She let me take it and I held it and put my arm around under her arm.</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. I kept my arm where it was.</p>
            <p>“Why not?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I said. “Please.” I leaned forward in the dark to kiss her and there was a
                sharp stinging flash. She had slapped my face hard. Her hand had hit my nose and
                eyes, and tears came in my eyes from the reflex.</p>
            <p>“I’m so sorry,” she said. I felt I had a certain advantage.</p>
            <p>“You were quite right.”</p>
            <p>“I’m dreadfully sorry,” she said. “I just couldn’t stand the nurse’s-evening-off
                aspect of it. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I did hurt you, didn’t I ?”</p>
            <p>She was looking at me in the dark. I was angry and yet certain, seeing it all ahead
                like the moves in a chess game.</p>
            <p>“You did exactly right,” I said. “I don’t mind at all.”</p>
            <p>“Poor man.”</p>
            <p>“You see I’ve been leading a sort of a funny life. <pb n="27"/> And I never even talk
                English. And then you are so very beautiful.” I looked at her.</p>
            <p>“You don’t need to say a lot of nonsense. I said I was sorry. We do get along.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I said. “And we have gotten away from the war.”</p>
            <p>She laughed. It was the first time I had ever heard her laugh. I watched her
                face.</p>
            <p>“You are sweet,” she said.</p>
            <p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. You are a dear. I’d be glad to kiss you if you don’t mind.”</p>
            <p>I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I had before and kissed her. I
                kissed her hard and held her tight and tried to open her lips; they were closed
                tight. I was still angry and as I held her suddenly she shivered. I held her close
                against me and could feel her heart beating and her lips opened and her head went
                back against my hand and then she was crying on my shoulder.</p>
            <p>“Oh, darling,” she said. “You will be good to me, won’t you?”</p>
            <p>What the hell, I thought. I stroked her hair and patted her shoulder. She was
                crying.</p>
            <p>“You will, won’t you?” She looked up at me. “Because we’re going to have a strange
                life.”</p>
            <p>After a while I walked with her to the door of the villa and she went in and I walked
                home. Back at the villa I went upstairs to the room. Rinaldi was lying on his bed.
                He looked at me.</p>
            <p>“So you make progress with Miss Barkley?”</p>
            <p>“We are friends.”</p>
            <p>“You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat.”</p>
            <p>I did not understand the word.</p>
            <pb n="28"/>
            <p>“Of a what?”</p>
            <p>He explained.</p>
            <p>“You,” I said, “have that pleasant air of a dog who—”</p>
            <p>“Stop it,” he said. “In a little while we would say insulting things.” He
                laughed.</p>
            <p>“Good-night,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Good-night, little puppy.”</p>
            <p>I knocked over his candle with the pillow and got into bed in the dark.</p>
            <p>Rinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on reading.</p>

            <p>I was away for two days at the posts. When I got home it was too late and I did not
                see Miss Barkley until the next evening. She was not in the garden and I had to wait
                in the office of the hospital until she came down. There were many marble busts on
                painted wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used for an office. The hall
                too, that the office opened on, was lined with them. They had the complete marble
                quality of all looking alike. Sculpture had always seemed a dull business—still,
                bronzes looked like something. But marble busts all looked like a cemetery. There
                was one fine cemetery though—the one at Pisa. Genoa was the place to see the bad
                marbles. This had been the villa of a very wealthy German and the busts must have
                cost him plenty. I wondered who had done them and how much he got. I tried to make
                out whether they were members of the family or what; but they were all uniformly
                classical. You could not tell anything about them.</p>
            <p>I sat on a chair and held my cap. We were supposed to wear steel helmets even in
                Gorizia but they were uncomfortable and too bloody theatrical in a town where the
                civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated. I wore one when we went up to the posts
                and carried an English gas mask. We were just beginning to get some of them. They
                were a real mask. Also we were required to wear an automatic pistol; even doctors
                and sanitary officers. I felt it against the back of the chair. You <pb n="30"/>
                were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in plain sight. Rinaldi carried a
                holster stuffed with toilet paper. I wore a real one and felt like a gunman until I
                practised firing it. It was an Astra 7.65 caliber with a short barrel and it jumped
                so sharply when you let it off that there was no question of hitting anything. I
                practised with it, holding below the target and trying to master the jerk of the
                ridiculous short barrel until I could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty
                paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol at all came over me and I
                soon forgot it and carried it flopping against the small of my back with no feeling
                at all except a vague sort of shame when I met English-speaking people. I sat now in
                the chair and an orderly of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind a desk
                while I looked at the marble floor, the pillars with the marble busts, and the
                frescoes on the wall and waited for Miss Barkley. The frescoes were not bad. Any
                frescoes were good when they started to peel and flake off.</p>
            <p>I saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall, and stood up. She did not seem tall
                walking toward me but she looked very lovely.</p>
            <p>“Good-evening, Mr. Henry,” she said.</p>
            <p>How do you do ?” I said. The orderly was listening behind the desk.</p>
            <p>Shall we sit here or go out in the garden?” Let’s go out. It’s much cooler.”</p>
            <p>I walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly looking after us. When we were
                out on the gravel drive she said, “Where have you been?”</p>
            <p>“I’ve been out on post.”</p>
            <p>“You couldn’t have sent me a note?”</p>
            <pb n="31"/>
            <p>“No,” I said. “Not very well. I thought I was coming back.”</p>
            <p>“You ought to have let me know, darling.”</p>
            <p>We were off the driveway, walking under the trees. I took her hands, then stopped and
                kissed her.</p>
            <p>“Isn’t there anywhere we can go?”</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. “We have to just walk here. You’ve been away a long time.”</p>
            <p>“This is the third day. But I’m back now.”</p>
            <p>She looked at me, “And you do love me?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“You did say you loved me, didn’t you?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I lied. “I love you.” I had not said it before.</p>
            <p>“And you call me Catherine ?”</p>
            <p>“Catherine.” We walked on a way and were stopped under a tree.</p>
            <p>“Say, ‘I’ve come back to Catherine in the night.’ ”</p>
            <p>“I’ve come back to Catherine in the night.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, darling, you have come back, haven’t you ?” “Yes.”</p>
            <p>“I love you so and it’s been awful. You won’t go away?”</p>
            <p>“No. I’ll always come back.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, I love you so. Please put your hand there again.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not been away.” I turned her so I could see her face when I kissed her and I
                saw that her eyes were shut. I kissed both her shut eyes. I thought she was probably
                a little crazy. It was all right if she was. I did not care what I was getting into.
                This was better than going every evening to the house for officers where the girls
                climbed all over you and put your cap on backward
                <pb n="32"/> as a sign of affection between their trips upstairs with brother
                officers. I knew I did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her.
                This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards.
                Like bridge you had to pretend you were playing for money or playing for some
                stakes. Nobody had mentioned what the stakes were. It was all right with me.</p>
            <p>“I wish there was some place we could go,” I said. I was experiencing the masculine
                difficulty of making love very long standing up.</p>
            <p>“There isn’t any place,” she said. She came back from wherever she had been.</p>
            <p>“We might sit there just for a little while.”</p>
            <p>We sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine Barkley’s hand. She would not let
                me put my arm around her.</p>
            <p>“Are you very tired?” she asked.</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>She looked down at the grass.</p>
            <p>“This is a rotten game we play, isn’t it?”</p>
            <p>“What game?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t be dull”</p>
            <p>“I’m not, on purpose.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a nice boy,” she said. “And you play it as well as you know how. But it’s a
                rotten game.”</p>
            <p>“Do you always know what people think?”</p>
            <p>“Not always. But I do with you. You don’t have to pretend you love me. That’s over
                for the evening. Is there anything you’d like to talk about?”</p>
            <p>“But I do love you.”</p>
            <p>“Please let’s not lie when we don’t have to. I had a very fine little show and I’m
                all right now. You see <pb n="33"/> I’m not mad and I’m not gone off. It’s only a
                little sometimes.”</p>
            <p>I pressed her hand, “Dear Catherine.”</p>
            <p>“It sounds very funny now—Catherine. You don’t pronounce it very much alike. But
                you’re very nice. You’re a very good boy.”</p>
            <p>“That’s what the priest said.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, you’re very good. And you will come and see me?”</p>
            <p>“Of course.”</p>
            <p>“And you don’t have to say you love me. That’s all over for a while.” She stood up
                and put out her hand. “Good-night”</p>
            <p>I wanted to kiss her.</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. “I’m awfully tired.”</p>
            <p>“Kiss me, though,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I’m awfully tired, darling.”</p>
            <p>“Kiss me.”</p>
            <p>“Do you want to very much?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>We kissed and she broke away suddenly. “No. Good-night, please, darling.” We walked
                to the door and I saw her go in and down the hall. I liked to watch her move. She
                went on down the hall. I went on home. It was a hot night and there was a good deal
                going on up in the mountains. I watched the flashes on San Gabriele.</p>
            <p>I stopped in front of the Villa Rossa. The shutters were up but it was still going on
                inside. Somebody was singing. I went on home. Rinaldi came in while I was
                undressing.</p>
            <p>“Ah, ha!” he said. “It does not go so well. Baby is puzzled.”</p>
            <p>“Where have you been?”</p>
            <pb n="34"/>
            <p>“At the Villa Rossa. It was very edifying, baby. We all sang. Where have you been
                ?”</p>
            <p>“Calling on the British.”</p>
            <p>“Thank God I did not become involved with the British.”</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VII</head>

            <p>I came back the next afternoon from our first mountain post and stopped the car at
                the <hi>smistimento</hi> where the wounded and sick were sorted by their papers and
                the papers marked for the different hospitals. I had been driving and I sat in the
                car and the driver took the papers in. It was a hot day and the sky was very bright
                and blue and the road was white and dusty. I sat in the high seat of the Fiat and
                thought about nothing. A regiment went by in the road and I watched them pass. The
                men were hot and sweating. Some wore their steel helmets but most of them carried
                them slung from their packs. Most of the helmets were too big and came down almost
                over the ears of the men who wore them. The officers all wore helmets;
                better-fitting helmets. It was half of the brigata Basilicata. I identified them by
                their red and white striped collar mark. There were stragglers going by long after
                the regiment had passed--men who could not keep up with their platoons. They were
                sweaty, dusty and tired. Some looked pretty bad. A soldier came along after the last
                of the stragglers. He was walking with a limp. He stopped and sat down beside the
                road. I got down and went over.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter ?”</p>
            <p>He looked at me, then stood up.</p>
            <p>“I’m going on.”</p>
            <p>“What’s the trouble ?”</p>
            <p>“---- the war.”</p>
            <p>“What’s wrong with your leg?”</p>
            <p>“It’s not my leg. I got a rupture.”</p>
            <pb n="36"/>
            <p>“Why don’t you ride with the transport?” I asked. “Why don’t you go to the
                hospital?”</p>
            <p>“They won’t let me. The lieutenant said I slipped the truss on purpose.”</p>
            <p>“Let me feel it.”</p>
            <p>“It’s way out.”</p>
            <p>“Which side is it on?”</p>
            <p>“Here.”</p>
            <p>I felt it.</p>
            <p>“Cough,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid it will make it bigger. It’s twice as big as it was this morning.”</p>
            <p>“Sit down,” I said. “As soon as I get the papers on these wounded I’ll take you along
                the road and drop you with your medical officers.”</p>
            <p>“He’ll say I did it on purpose.”</p>
            <p>“They can’t do anything,” I said. “It’s not a wound. You’ve had it before, haven’t
                you ?”</p>
            <p>“But I lost the truss.”</p>
            <p>“They’ll send you to a hospital.”</p>
            <p>“Can’t I stay here, Tenente?”</p>
            <p>“No, I haven’t any papers for you.”</p>
            <p>The driver came out of the door with the papers for the wounded in the car.</p>
            <p>“Four for 105. Two for 132,” he said. They were hospitals beyond the river.</p>
            <p>“You drive,” I said. I helped the soldier with the rupture up on the seat with
                us.</p>
            <p>“You speak English?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“Sure.”</p>
            <p>“How you like this goddam war?”</p>
            <p>“Rotten.”</p>
            <p>“I say it’s rotten. Jesus Christ, I say it’s rotten.”</p>
            <p>“Were you in the States?”</p>
            <pb n="37"/>
            <p>“Sure. In Pittsburg. I knew you was an American.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t I talk Italian good enough?”</p>
            <p>“I knew you was an American all right”</p>
            <p>“Another American,” said the driver in Italian looking at the hernia man.</p>
            <p>“Listen, lootenant. Do you have to take me to that regiment?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“Because the captain doctor knew I had this rupture. I threw away the goddam truss so
                it would get bad and I wouldn’t have to go to the line again.”</p>
            <p>“I see.”</p>
            <p>“Couldn’t you take me no place else?”</p>
            <p>“If it was closer to the front I could take you to a first medical post. But back
                here you’ve got to have papers.”</p>
            <p>“If I go back they’ll make me get operated on and then they’ll put me in the line all
                the time.”</p>
            <p>I thought it over.</p>
            <p>“You wouldn’t want to go in the line all the time, would you?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Jesus Christ, ain’t this a goddam war?”</p>
            <p>“Listen,” I said. “You get out and fall down by the road and get a bump on your head
                and I’ll pick you up on our way back and take you to a hospital. We’ll stop by the
                road here, Aldo.” We stopped at the side of the road. I helped him down.</p>
            <p>“I’ll be right here, lieutenant,” he said.</p>
            <p>“So long,” I said. We went on and passed the regiment about a mile ahead, then
                crossed the river, cloudy with snow-water and running fast through the spiles of the
                bridge, to ride along the road across the plain <pb n="38"/> and deliver the wounded
                at the two hospitals. I drove coming back and went fast with the empty car to find
                the man from Pittsburg. First we passed the regiment, hotter and slower than ever:
                then the stragglers. Then we saw a horse ambulance stopped by the road. Two men were
                lifting the hernia man to put him in. They had come back for him. He shook his head
                at me. His helmet was off and his forehead was bleeding below the hair line. His
                nose was skinned and there was dust on the bloody patch and dust in his hair.</p>
            <p>“Look at the bump, lieutenant!” he shouted. “Nothing to do. They come back for
                me.”</p>
            <p>When I got back to the villa it was five o’clock and I went out where we washed the
                cars, to take a shower. Then I made out my report in my room, sitting in my trousers
                and an undershirt in front of the open window. In two days the offensive was to
                start and I would go with the cars to Plava. It was a long time since I had written
                to the States and I knew I should write but I had let it go so long that it was
                almost impossible to write now. There was nothing to write about. I sent a couple of
                army Zona di Guerra postcards, crossing out everything except, I am well. That
                should handle them. Those post-cards would be very fine in America; strange and
                mysterious. This was a strange and mysterious war zone but I supposed it was quite
                well run and grim compared to other wars with the Austrians. The Austrian army was
                created to give Napoleon victories; any Napoleon. I wished we had a Napoleon, but
                instead we had Il Generale Cadorna, fat and prosperous, and Vittorio Emmanuele, the
                tiny man with the long thin neck and the goat beard. Over on the right they had the
                Duke of Aosta. Maybe he <pb n="39"/> was too good-looking to be a great general but
                he looked like a man. Lots of them would have liked him to be king. He looked like a
                king. He was the King’s uncle and commanded the third army. We were in the second
                army. There were some British batteries up with the third army. I had met two
                gunners from that lot, in Milan. They were very nice and we had a big evening. They
                were big and shy and embarrassed and very appreciative together of anything that
                happened. I wish that I was with the British. It would have been much simpler. Still
                I would probably have been killed. Not in this ambulance business. Yes, even in the
                ambulance business. British ambulance drivers were killed sometimes. Well, I knew I
                would not be killed. Not in this war. It did not have anything to do with me. It
                seemed no more dangerous to me myself than war in the movies. I wished to God it was
                over though. Maybe it would finish this summer. Maybe the Austrians would crack.
                They had always cracked in other wars. What was the matter with this war? Everybody
                said the French were through. Rinaldi said that the French had mutinied and troops
                marched on Paris. I asked him what happened and he said, “Oh, they stopped them.” I
                wanted to go to Austria without war. I wanted to go to the Black Forest. I wanted to
                go to the Hartz Mountains. Where were the Hartz Mountains anyway? They were fighting
                in the Carpathians. I did not want to go there anyway. It might be good though. I
                could go to Spain if there was no war. The sun was going down and the day was
                cooling off. After supper I would go and see Catherine Barkley. I wished she were
                here now. I wished I were in Milan with her. I would like to eat at the Cova and
                then walk down the Via Manzoni in the hot evening and cross over and <pb n="40"/>
                turn off along the canal and go to the hotel with Catherine Barkley. Maybe she
                would. Maybe she would pretend that I was her boy that was killed and we would go in
                the front door and the porter would take off his cap and I would stop at the
                concierge’s desk and ask for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then we
                would get in the elevator and it would go up very slowly clicking at all the floors
                and then our floor and the boy would open the door and stand there and she would
                step out and I would step out and we would walk down the hall and I would put the
                key in the door and open it and go in and then take down the telephone and ask them
                to send a bottle of capri bianca in a silver bucket full of ice and you would hear
                the ice against the pail coming down the corridor and the boy would knock and I
                would say leave it outside the door please. Because we would not wear any clothes
                because it was so hot and the window open and the swallows flying over the roofs of
                the houses and when it was dark afterward and you went to the window very small bats
                hunting over the houses and close down over the trees and we would drink the capri
                and the door locked and it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we would
                both love each other all night in the hot night in Milan. That was how it ought to
                be. I would eat quickly and go and see Catherine Barkley.</p>
            <p>They talked too much at the mess and I drank wine because to-night we were not all
                brothers unless I drank a little and talked with the priest about Archbishop Ireland
                who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose injustice, the injustices he had
                received and in which I participated as an American, and of which I had never heard,
                I feigned acquaintance. It would have been impolite not to have known something of
                them when I had <pb n="41"/> listened to such a splendid explanation of their causes
                which were, after all, it seemed, misunderstandings. I thought he had a fine name
                and he came from Minnesota which made a lovely name: Ireland of Minnesota, Ireland
                of Wisconsin, Ireland of Michigan. What made it pretty was that it sounded like
                Island. No that wasn’t it. There was more to it than that. Yes, father. That is
                true, father. Perhaps, father. No, father. Well, maybe yes, father. You know more
                about it than I do, father. The priest was good but dull. The officers were not good
                but dull. The King was good but dull. The wine was bad but not dull. It took the
                enamel off your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth.</p>
            <p>“And the priest was locked up,” Rocca said, “because they found the three per cent
                bonds on his person. It was in France of course. Here they would never have arrested
                him. He denied all knowledge of the five per cent bonds. This took place at Béziers.
                I was there and reading of it in the paper, went to the jail and asked to see the
                priest. It was quite evident he had stolen the bonds.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe a word of this,” Rinaldi said.</p>
            <p>“Just as you like,” Rocca said. “But I am telling it for our priest here. It is very
                informative. He is a priest; he will appreciate it.”</p>
            <p>The priest smiled. “Go on,” he said. “I am listening.”</p>
            <p>“Of course some of the bonds were not accounted for but the priest had all of the
                three per cent bonds and several local obligations, I forget exactly what they were.
                So I went to the jail, now this is the point of the story, and I stood outside his
                cell and I said as though I were going to confession, ‘Bless me, father, for you
                have sinned.’”</p>
            <pb n="42"/>
            <p>There was great laughter from everybody.</p>
            <p>“And what did he say?” asked the priest. Rocca ignored this and went on to explain
                the joke to me. “You see the point, don’t you?” It seemed it was a very funny joke
                if you understood it properly. They poured me more wine and I told the story about
                the English private soldier who was placed under the shower bath. Then the major
                told the story of the eleven Czecho-slovaks and the Hungarian corporal. After some
                more wine I told the story of the jockey who found the penny. The major said there
                was an Italian story something like that about the duchess who could not sleep at
                night. At this point the priest left and I told the story about the travelling
                salesman who arrived at five o’clock in the morning at Marseilles when the mistral
                was blowing. The major said he had heard a report that I could drink. I denied this.
                He said it was true and by the corpse of Bacchus we would test whether it was true
                or not. Not Bacchus, I said. Not Bacchus. Yes, Bacchus, he said. I should drink cup
                for cup and glass for glass with Bassi, Fillipo Vincenza. Bassi said no that was no
                test because he had already drunk twice as much as I. I said that was a foul lie
                and, Bacchus or no Bacchus, Fillipo Vincenza Bassi or Bassi Fillippo Vicenza had
                never touched a drop all evening and what was his name anyway ? He said was my name
                Frederico Enrico or Enrico Federico? I said let the best man win, Bacchus barred,
                and the major started us with red wine in mugs. Half-way through the wine I did not
                want any more. I remembered where I was going.</p>
            <p>“Bassi wins,” I said. “He’s a better man than I am. I have to go.”</p>
            <p>“He does really,” said Rinaldi. “He has a rendezvous. I know all about it.”</p>
            <pb n="43"/>
            <p>“I have to go.”</p>
            <p>“Another night,” said Bassi. “Another night when you feel stronger.” He slapped me on
                the shoulder. There were lighted candles on the table. All the officers were very
                happy. “Good-night, gentlemen,” I said.</p>
            <p>Rinaldi went out with me. We stood outside the door on the patch and he said, “You’d
                better not go up there drunk.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not drunk, Rinin. Really.”</p>
            <p>“You’d better chew some coffee.”</p>
            <p>“Nonsense.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll get some, baby. You walk up and down.” He came back with a handful of roasted
                coffee beans. “Chew those, baby, and God be with you.”</p>
            <p>“Bacchus,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I’ll walk down with you.”</p>
            <p>“I’m perfectly all right.”</p>
            <p>We walked along together through the town and I chewed the coffee. At the gate of the
                driveway that led up to the British villa, Rinaldi said good-night.</p>
            <p>“Good-night,” I said. “Why don’t you come in?”</p>
            <p>He shook his head. “No,” he said, “I like the simpler pleasures.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you for the coffee beans.”</p>
            <p>“Nothing, baby. Nothing.”</p>
            <p>I started down the driveway. The outlines of the cypresses that lined it were sharp
                and clear. I looked back and saw Rinaldi standing watching me and waved to him.</p>
            <p>I sat in the reception hall of the villa, waiting for Catherine Barkley to come down.
                Some one was coming down the hall-way. I stood up, but it was not Catherine. It was
                Miss Ferguson.</p>
            <p>“Hello,” she said. “Catherine asked me to tell you she was sorry she couldn’t see you
                this evening.”</p>
            <pb n="44"/>
            <p>“I’m so sorry. I hope she’s not ill.”</p>
            <p>“She’s not awfully well.”</p>
            <p>“Will you tell her how sorry I am?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
            <p>“Do you think it would be any good to try and see her to-morrow?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you very much,” I said. “Good-night.”</p>
            <p>I went out the door and suddenly I felt lonely and empty. I had treated seeing
                Catherine very lightly, I had gotten somewhat drunk and had nearly forgotten to come
                but when I could not see her there I was feeling lonely and hollow.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
            <p>The next afternoon we heard there was to be an attack up the river that night and
                that we were to take four cars there. Nobody knew anything about it although they
                all spoke with great positiveness and strategical knowledge. I was riding in the
                first car and as we passed the entry to the British hospital I told the driver to
                stop. The other cars pulled up. I got out and told the driver to go on and that if
                we had not caught up to them at the junction of the road to Cormons to wait there. I
                hurried up the driveway and inside the reception hall I asked for Miss Barkley.</p>
            <p>“She’s on duty.”</p>
            <p>“Could I see her just for a moment?”</p>
            <p>They sent an orderly to see and she came back with him.</p>
            <p>“I stopped to ask if you were better. They told me you were on duty, so I asked to
                see you.”</p>
            <p>“I’m quite well,” she said, “I think the heat knocked me over yesterday.”</p>
            <p>“I have to go.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll just step out the door a minute.”</p>
            <p>“And you’re all right ?” I asked outside.</p>
            <p>“Yes, darling. Are you coming to-night?”</p>
            <p>“No. I’m leaving now for a show up above Plava.”</p>
            <p>“A show ?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think it’s anything.”</p>
            <p>“And you’ll be back ?”</p>
            <p>“To-morrow.”</p>
            <p>She was unclasping something from her neck. She <pb n="46"/> put it in my hand. “It’s
                a Saint Anthony,” she said. “And come to-morrow night.”</p>
            <p>“You’re not a Catholic, are you ?”</p>
            <p>“No. But they say a Saint Anthony’s very useful.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll take care of him for you. Good-by.”</p>
            <p>“No,” she said, “not good-by.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“Be a good boy and be careful. No, you can’t kiss me here. You can’t.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>I looked back and saw her standing on the steps. She waved and I kissed my hand and
                held it out. She waved again and then I was out of the driveway and climbing up into
                the seat of the ambulance and we started. The Saint Anthony was in a little white
                metal capsule. I opened the capsule and spilled him out into my hand.</p>
            <p>“Saint Anthony ?” asked the driver.</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“I have one.” His right hand left the wheel and opened a button on his tunic and
                pulled it out from under his shirt.</p>
            <p>“See?”</p>
            <p>I put my Saint Anthony back in the capsule, spilled the thin gold chain together and
                put it all in my breast pocket.</p>
            <p>“You don’t wear him?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>‘It’s better to wear him. That’s what it’s for.”</p>
            <p>All right,” I said. I undid the clasp of the gold chain and put it around my neck and
                clasped it. The saint hung down on the outside of my uniform and I undid the throat
                of my tunic, unbuttoned the shirt collar and dropped him in under the shirt. I felt
                him in <pb n="47"/> his metal box against my chest while we drove. Then I forgot
                about him. After I was wounded I never found him. Some one probably got it at one of
                the dressing stations.</p>
            <p>We drove fast when we were over the bridge and soon we saw the dust of the other cars
                ahead down the road. The road curved and we saw the three cars looking quite small,
                the dust rising from the wheels and going off through the trees. We caught them and
                passed them and turned off on a road that climbed up into the hills. Driving in
                convoy is not unpleasant if you are the first car and I settled back in the seat and
                watched the country. We were in the foot-hills on the near side of the river and as
                the road mounted there were the high mountains off to the north with snow still on
                the tops. I looked back and saw the three cars all climbing, spaced by the interval
                of their dust. We passed a long column of loaded mules, the drivers walking along
                beside the mules wearing red fezzes. They were bersaglieri.</p>
            <p>Beyond the mule train the road was empty and we climbed through the hills and then
                went down over the shoulder of a long hill into a river-valley. There were trees
                along both sides of the road and through the right line of trees I saw the river,
                the water clear, fast and shallow. The river was low and there were stretches of
                sand and pebbles with a narrow channel of water and sometimes the water spread like
                a sheen over the pebbly bed. Close to the bank I saw deep pools, the water blue like
                the sky. I saw arched stone bridges over the river where tracks turned off from the
                road and we passed stone farmhouses with pear trees candelabraed against their south
                walls and low stone walls in the fields. The road went up the valley a long way <pb
                    n="48"/> and then we turned off and commenced to climb into the hills again. The
                road climbed steeply going up and back and forth through chestnut woods to level
                finally along a ridge. I could look down through the woods and see, far below, with
                the sun on it, the line of the river that separated the two armies. We went along
                the rough new military road that followed the crest of the ridge and I looked to the
                north at the two ranges of mountains, green and dark to the snow-line and then white
                and lovely in the sun. Then, as the road mounted along the ridge, I saw a third
                range of mountains, higher snow mountains, that looked chalky white and furrowed,
                with strange planes, and then there were mountains far off beyond all these that you
                could hardly tell if you really saw. Those were all the Austrians’ mountains and we
                had nothing like them. Ahead there was a rounded turn-off in the road to the right
                and looking down I could see the road dropping through the trees. There were troops
                on this road and motor trucks and mules with mountain guns and as we went down,
                keeping to the side, I could see the river far down below, the line of ties and
                rails running along it, the old bridge where the railway crossed to the other side
                and across, under a hill beyond the river, the broken houses of the little town that
                was to be taken.</p>
            <p>It was nearly dark when we came down and turned onto the main road that ran beside
                the river.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="9">
            <pb n="49"/>
            <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
            <p>The road was crowded and there were screens of corn-stalk and straw matting on both
                sides and matting over the top so that it was like the entrance at a circus or a
                native village. We drove slowly in this matting-covered tunnel and came out onto a
                bare cleared space where the railway station had been. The road here was below the
                level of the river bank and all along the side of the sunken road there were holes
                dug in the bank with infantry in them. The sun was going down and looking up along
                the bank as we drove I saw the Austrian observation balloons above the hills on the
                other side dark against the sunset. We parked the cars beyond a brickyard. The ovens
                and some deep holes had been equipped as dressing stations. There were three doctors
                that I knew. I talked with the major and learned that when it should start and our
                cars should be loaded we would drive them back along the screened road and up to the
                main road along the ridge where there would be a post and other cars to clear them.
                He hoped the road would not jam. It was a one-road show. The road was screened
                because it was in sight of the Austrians across the river. Here at the brickyard we
                were sheltered from rifle or machine-gun fire by the river bank. There was one
                smashed bridge across the river. They were going to put over another bridge when the
                bombardment started and some troops were to cross at the shallows up above at the
                bend of the river. The major was a little man with upturned mustaches. He had been
                in the war in Libya and wore two wound-stripes. He said that if the thing went well
                he <pb n="50"/> would see that I was decorated. I said I hoped it would go well but
                that he was too kind. I asked him if there was a big dugout where the drivers could
                stay and he sent a soldier to show me. I went with him and found the dugout, which
                was very good. The drivers were pleased with it and I left them there. The major
                asked me to have a drink with him and two other officers. We drank rum and it was
                very friendly. Outside it was getting dark. I asked what time the attack was to be
                and they said as soon as it was dark. I went back to the drivers. They were sitting
                in the dugout talking and when I came in they stopped. I gave them each a package of
                cigarettes, Macedonias, loosely packed cigarettes that spilled tobacco and needed to
                have the ends twisted before you smoked them. Manera lit his lighter and passed it
                around. The lighter was shaped like a Fiat radiator. I told them what I had
                heard.</p>
            <p>“Why didn’t we see the post when we came down?” Passini asked.</p>
            <p>“It was just beyond where we turned off.”</p>
            <p>“That road will be a dirty mess,” Manera said.</p>
            <p>“They’ll shell the ----- out of us.”</p>
            <p>“Probably.”</p>
            <p>“What about eating, lieutenant? We won’t get a chance to eat after this thing
                starts.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll go and see now,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You want us to stay here or can we look around?” “Better stay here.”</p>
            <p>I went back to the major’s dugout and he said the field kitchen would be along and
                the drivers could come and get their stew. He would loan them mess tins if they did
                not have them. I said I thought they had them. I went back and told the drivers I
                would get them as soon as the food came. Manera said he hoped it would come before
                    <pb n="51"/> the bombardment started. They were silent until I went out. They
                were all mechanics and hated the war.</p>
            <p>I went out to look at the cars and see what was going on and then came back and sat
                down in the dugout with the four drivers. We sat on the ground with our backs
                against the wall and smoked. Outside it was nearly dark. The earth of the dugout was
                warm and dry and I let my shoulders back against the wall, sitting on the small of
                my back, and relaxed.</p>
            <p>“Who goes to the attack?” asked Gavuzzi.</p>
            <p>“Bersaglieri.”</p>
            <p>“All bersaglieri?”</p>
            <p>“I think so.”</p>
            <p>“There aren’t enough troops here for a real attack.”</p>
            <p>“It is probably to draw attention from where the real attack will be.”</p>
            <p>“Do the men know that who attack?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
            <p>“Of course they don’t,” Manera said. “They wouldn’t attack if they did.”</p>
            <p>“Yes they would,” Passini said. “Bersaglieri are fools.”</p>
            <p>“They are brave and have good discipline,” I said.</p>
            <p>“They are big through the chest by measurement, and healthy. But they are still
                fools.”</p>
            <p>“The granatieri are tall,” Manera said. This was a joke. They all laughed.</p>
            <p>“Were you there, Tenente, when they wouldn’t attack and they shot every tenth
                man?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“It is true. They lined them up afterward and took every tenth man. Carabinieri shot
                them.”</p>
            <p>“Carabinieri,” said Passini and spat on the floor. <pb n="52"/> “But those
                grenadiers; all over six feet. They wouldn’t attack.”</p>
            <p>“If everybody would not attack the war would be over,” Manera said.</p>
            <p>“It wasn’t that way with the granatieri. They were afraid. The officers all came from
                such good families.”</p>
            <p>“Some of the officers went alone.”</p>
            <p>“A sergeant shot two officers who would not get out.”</p>
            <p>“Some troops went out.”</p>
            <p>“Those that went out were not lined up when they took the tenth men.”</p>
            <p>“One of those shot by the carabinieri is from my town,” Passini said. “He was a big
                smart tall boy to be in the granatieri. Always in Rome. Always with the girls.
                Always with the carabinieri.” He laughed. “Now they have a guard outside his house
                with a bayonet and nobody can come to see his mother and father and sisters and his
                father loses his civil rights and cannot even vote. They are all without law to
                protect them. Anybody can take their property.”</p>
            <p>“If it wasn’t that that happens to their families nobody would go to the attack.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. Alpini would. These V. E. soldiers would. Some bersaglieri.”</p>
            <p>“Bersaglieri have run too. Now they try to forget it.”</p>
            <p>“You should not let us talk this way, Tenente. Evviva l’esercito,” Passini said
                sarcastically.</p>
            <p>“I know how you talk,” I said. “But as long as you drive the cars and behave--”</p>
            <p>“—and don’t talk so other officers can hear,” Manera finished.</p>
            <p>“I believe we should get the war over,” I said. “It <pb n="53"/> would not finish it
                if one side stopped fighting. It would only be worse if we stopped fighting.”</p>
            <p>“It could not be worse,” Passini said respectfully. “There is nothing worse than
                war.”</p>
            <p>“Defeat is worse.”</p>
            <p>“I do not believe it,” Passini said still respectfully. “What is defeat? You go
                home.”</p>
            <p>“They come after you. They take your home. They take your sisters.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe it,” Passini said. “They can’t do that to everybody. Let everybody
                defend his home. Let them keep their sisters in the house.”</p>
            <p>“They hang you. They come and make you be a soldier again. Not in the auto-ambulance,
                in the infantry.”</p>
            <p>“They can’t hang every one.”</p>
            <p>“An outside nation can’t make you be a soldier,” Manera said. “At the first battle
                you all run.”</p>
            <p>“Like the Tchecos.”</p>
            <p>“I think you do not know anything about being conquered and so you think it is not
                bad.”</p>
            <p>“Tenente,” Passini said. “We understand you let us talk. Listen. There is nothing as
                bad as war. We in the auto-ambulance cannot even realize at all how bad it is. When
                people realize how bad it is they cannot do anything to stop it because they go
                crazy. There are some people who never realize. There are people who are afraid of
                their officers. It is with them that war is made.”</p>
            <p>“I know it is bad but we must finish it.”</p>
            <p>“It doesn’t finish. There is no finish to a war.”</p>
            <p>“Yes there is.”</p>
            <p>Passini shook his head.</p>
            <p>“War is not won by victory. What if we take San <pb n="54"/> Gabriele? What if we
                take the Carso and Monfalcone and Trieste ? Where are we then ? Did you see all the
                far mountains to-day? Do you think we could take all them too? Only if the Austrians
                stop fighting. One side must stop fighting. Why don’t we stop fighting? If they come
                down into Italy they will get tired and go away. They have their own country. But
                no, instead there is a war.”</p>
            <p>“You’re an orator.”</p>
            <p>“We think. We read. We are not peasants. We are mechanics. But even the peasants know
                better than to believe in a war. Everybody hates this war.”</p>
            <p>“There is a class that controls a country that is stupid and does not realize
                anything and never can. That is why we have this war.”</p>
            <p>“Also they make money out of it.”</p>
            <p>“Most of them don’t,” said Passini. “They are too stupid. They do it for nothing. For
                stupidity.”</p>
            <p>“We must shut up,” said Manera. “We talk too much even for the Tenente.”</p>
            <p>“He likes it,” said Passini. “We will convert him.” “But now we will shut up,” Manera
                said.</p>
            <p>“Do we eat yet, Tenente?” Gavuzzi asked.</p>
            <p>“I will go and see,” I said. Gordini stood up and went outside with me.</p>
            <p>“Is there anything I can do, Tenente? Can I help in any way?” He was the quietest one
                of the four. “Come with me if you want,” I said, “and we’ll see.”</p>
            <p>It was dark outside and the long light from the search-lights was moving over the
                mountains. There were big search-lights on that front mounted on camions that you
                passed sometimes on the roads at night, close behind the lines, the camion stopped a
                little off the road, an officer directing the light and the crew scared. <pb n="55"
                /> We crossed the brickyard, and stopped at the main dressing station. There was a
                little shelter of green branches outside over the entrance and in the dark the night
                wind rustled the leaves dried by the sun. Inside there was a light. The major was at
                the telephone sitting on a box. One of the medical captains said the attack had been
                put forward an hour. He offered me a glass of cognac. I looked at the board tables,
                the instruments shining in the light, the basins and the stoppered bottles. Gordini
                stood behind me. The major got up from the telephone.</p>
            <p>“It starts now,” he said. “It has been put back again.”</p>
            <p>I looked outside, it was dark and the Austrian searchlights were moving on the
                mountains behind us. It was quiet for a moment still, then from all the guns behind
                us the bombardment started.</p>
            <p>“Savoia,” said the major.</p>
            <p>“About the soup, major,” I said. He did not hear me. I repeated it.</p>
            <p>“It hasn’t come up.”</p>
            <p>A big shell came in and burst outside in the brickyard. Another burst and in the
                noise you could hear the smaller noise of the brick and dirt raining down.</p>
            <p>“What is there to eat ?”</p>
            <p>“We have a little pasta asciutta,” the major said.</p>
            <p>“I’ll take what you can give me.”</p>
            <p>The major spoke to an orderly who went out of sight in the back and came back with a
                metal basin of cold cooked macaroni. I handed it to Gordini.</p>
            <p>“Have you any cheese?”</p>
            <p>The major spoke grudgingly to the orderly who ducked back into the hole again and
                came out with a quarter of a white cheese.</p>
            <pb n="56"/>
            <p>“Thank you very much,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You’d better not go out.”</p>
            <p>Outside something was set down beside the entrance. One of the two men who had
                carried it looked in.</p>
            <p>“Bring him in,” said the major. “What’s the matter with you? Do you want us to come
                outside and get him ?”</p>
            <p>The two stretcher-bearers picked up the man under the arms and by the legs and
                brought him in.</p>
            <p>“Slit the tunic,” the major said.</p>
            <p>He held a forceps with some gauze in the end. The two captains took off their coats.
                “Get out of here,” the major said to the two stretcher-bearers.</p>
            <p>“Come on,” I said to Gordini.</p>
            <p>“You better wait until the shelling is over,” the major said over his shoulder.</p>
            <p>“They want to eat,” I said.</p>
            <p>“As you wish.”</p>
            <p>Outside we ran across the brickyard. A shell burst short near the river bank. Then
                there was one that we did not hear coming until the sudden rush. We both went flat
                and with the flash and bump of the burst and the smell heard the singing off of the
                fragments and the rattle of falling brick. Gordini got up and ran for the dugout. I
                was after him, holding the cheese, its smooth surface covered with brick dust.
                Inside the dugout were the three drivers sitting against the wall, smoking.</p>
            <p>“Here, you patriots,” I said.</p>
            <p>“How are the cars ?” Manera asked.</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“Did they scare you, Tenente ?”</p>
            <p>“You’re damned right,” I said.</p>
            <p>I took out my knife, opened it, wiped off the blade <pb n="57"/> and pared off the
                dirty outside surface of the cheese. Gavuzzi handed me the basin of macaroni.</p>
            <p>“Start in to eat, Tenente.”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said. “Put it on the floor. We’ll all eat.”</p>
            <p>“There are no forks.”</p>
            <p>“What the hell,” I said in English.</p>
            <p>I cut the cheese into pieces and laid them on the macaroni.</p>
            <p>“Sit down to it,” I said. They sat down and waited. I put thumb and fingers into the
                macaroni and lifted. A mass loosened.</p>
            <p>“Lift it high, Tenente.”</p>
            <p>I lifted it to arm’s length and the strands cleared. I lowered it into the mouth,
                sucked and snapped in the ends, and chewed, then took a bite of cheese, chewed, and
                then a drink of the wine. It tasted of rusty metal. I handed the canteen back to
                Passini.</p>
            <p>“It’s rotten,” he said. “It’s been in there too long. I had it in the car.”</p>
            <p>They were all eating, holding their chins close over the basin, tipping their heads
                back, sucking in the ends. I took another mouthful and some cheese and a rinse of
                wine. Something landed outside that shook the earth.</p>
            <p>“Four hundred twenty or minnenwerfer,” Gavuzzi said.</p>
            <p>“There aren’t any four hundred twenties in the mountains,” I said.</p>
            <p>“They have big Skoda guns. I’ve seen the holes.”</p>
            <p>“Three hundred fives.”</p>
            <p>We went on eating. There was a cough, a noise like a railway engine starting and then
                an explosion that shook the earth again.</p>
            <p>“This isn’t a deep dugout,” Passini said.</p>
            <p>“That was a big trench mortar.”</p>

            <pb n="58"/>

            <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
            <p>I ate the end of my piece of cheese and took a swallow of wine. Through the other
                noise I heard a cough, then came the chuh-chuh-chuh-chuh--then there was a flash, as
                when a blast-furnace door is swung open, and a roar that started white and went red
                and on and on in a rushing wind. I tried to breathe but my breath would not come and
                I felt myself rush bodily out of myself and out and out and out and all the time
                bodily in the wind. I went out swiftly, all of myself, and I knew I was dead and
                that it had all been a mistake to think you just died. Then I floated, and instead
                of going on I felt myself slide back. I breathed and I was back. The ground was torn
                up and in front of my head there was a splintered beam of wood. In the jolt of my
                head I heard somebody crying. I thought somebody was screaming. I tried to move but
                I could not move. I heard the machine-guns and rifles firing across the river and
                all along the river. There was a great splashing and I saw the star-shells go up and
                burst and float whitely and rockets going up and heard the bombs, all this in a
                moment, and then I heard close to me some one saying “Mama Mia! Oh, mama Mia!” I
                pulled and twisted and got my legs loose finally and turned around and touched him.
                It was Passini and when I touched him he screamed. His legs were toward me and I saw
                in the dark and the light that they were both smashed above the knee. One leg was
                gone and the other was held by tendons and part of the trouser and the stump
                twitched and jerked as though it were not connected. He bit his arm and moaned, “Oh
                mama mia, mama Mia, then, “Dio te salve, Maria. Dio te salve, Maria. Oh Jesus shoot
                me Christ shoot me mama mia mama Mia oh purest lovely Mary shoot me. Stop it. Stop
                it. <pb n="59"/> Stop it. Oh Jesus lovely Mary stop it. Oh oh oh oh,” then choking,
                “Mama mama mia.” Then he was quiet, biting his arm, the stump of his leg
                twitching.</p>
            <p>“Porta feriti !” I shouted holding my hands cupped. “Porta Feriti !” I tried to get
                closer to Passini to try to put a tourniquet on the legs but I could not move. I
                tried again and my legs moved a little. I could pull backward along with my arms and
                elbows. Passini was quiet now. I sat beside him, undid my tunic and tried to rip the
                tail of my shirt. It would not rip and I bit the edge of the cloth to start it. Then
                I thought of his puttees. I had on wool stockings but Passini wore puttees. All the
                drivers wore puttees but Passini had only one leg. I unwound the puttee and while I
                was doing it I saw there was no need to try and make a tourniquet because he was
                dead already. I made sure he was dead. There were three others to locate. I sat up
                straight and as I did so something inside my head moved like the weights on a doll’s
                eyes and it hit me inside in back of my eyeballs. My legs felt warm and wet and my
                shoes were wet and warm inside. I knew that I was hit and leaned over and put my
                hand on my knee. My knee wasn’t there. My hand went in and my knee was down on my
                shin. I wiped my hand on my shirt and another floating light came very slowly down
                and I looked at my leg and was very afraid. Oh, God, I said, get me out of here. I
                knew, however, that there had been three others. There were four drivers. Passini
                was dead. That left three. Some one took hold of me under the arms and somebody else
                lifted my legs.</p>
            <p>“There are three others,” I said. “One is dead.”</p>
            <p>“It’s Manera. We went for a stretcher but there wasn’t any. How are you,
                Tenente?”</p>

            <pb n="60"/>

            <p>“Where is Gordini and Gavuzzi?”</p>
            <p>“Gordini’s at the post getting bandaged. Gavuzzi has your legs. Hold on to my neck,
                Tenente. Are you badly hit?”</p>
            <p>“In the leg. How is Gordini?”</p>
            <p>“He’s all right. It was a big trench mortar shell.”</p>
            <p>“Passini’s dead.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. He’s dead.”</p>
            <p>A shell fell close and they both dropped to the ground and dropped me. “I’m sorry,
                Tenente,” said Manera. “Hang onto my neck.”</p>
            <p>“If you drop me again.”</p>
            <p>“It was because we were scared.”</p>
            <p>“Are you unwounded?”</p>
            <p>“We are both wounded a little.”</p>
            <p>“Can Gordini drive?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
            <p>They dropped me once more before we reached the post.</p>
            <p>“You sons of bitches,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I am sorry, Tenente,” Manera said. “We won’t drop you again.”</p>
            <p>Outside the post a great many of us lay on the ground in the dark. They carried
                wounded in and brought them out. I could see the light come out from the dressing
                station when the curtain opened and they brought some one in or out. The dead were
                off to one side. The doctors were working with their sleeves up to their shoulders
                and were red as butchers. There were not enough stretchers. Some of the wounded were
                noisy but most were quiet. The wind blew the leaves in the bower over the door of
                the dressing station and the night was getting cold. Stretcher-bearers <pb n="61"/>
                came in all the time, put their stretchers down, unloaded them and went away. As
                soon as I got to the dressing station Manera brought a medical sergeant out and he
                put bandages on both my legs. He said there was so much dirt blown into the wound
                that there had not been much hemorrhage. They would take me as soon as possible. He
                went back inside. Gordini could not drive, Manera said. His shoulder was smashed and
                his head was hurt. He had not felt bad but now the shoulder had stiffened. He was
                sitting up beside one of the brick walls. Manera and Gavuzzi each went off with a
                load of wounded. They could drive all right. The British had come with three
                ambulances and they had two men on each ambulance. One of their drivers came over to
                me, brought by Gordini who looked very white and sick. The Britisher leaned
                over.</p>
            <p>“Are you hit badly?” he asked. He was a tall man and wore steel-rimmed
                spectacles.</p>
            <p>“In the legs.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not serious I hope. Will you have a cigarette?” “Thanks.”</p>
            <p>“They tell me you’ve lost two drivers.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. One killed and the fellow that brought you.” “What rotten luck. Would you like
                us to take the cars?”</p>
            <p>“That’s what I wanted to ask you.”</p>
            <p>“We’d take quite good care of them and return them to the Villa. 206 aren’t you
                ?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“It’s a charming place. I’ve seen you about. They tell me you’re an American.”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“I’m English.”</p>

            <pb n="62"/>

            <p>“No!”</p>
            <p>“Yes, English. Did you think I was Italian? There were some Italians with one of our
                units.”</p>
            <p>“It would be fine if you would take the cars,” I said.</p>
            <p>“We’ll be most careful of them,” he straightened up. “This chap of yours was very
                anxious for me to see you.” He patted Gordini on the shoulder. Gordini winced and
                smiled. The Englishman broke into voluble and perfect Italian. “Now everything is
                arranged. I’ve seen your Tenente. We will take over the two cars. You won’t worry
                now.” He broke off, “I must do something about getting you out of here. I’ll see the
                medical wallahs. We’ll take you back with us.”</p>
            <p>He walked across to the dressing station, stepping carefully among the wounded. I saw
                the blanket open, the light came out and he went in.</p>
            <p>“He will look after you, Tenente,” Gordini said.</p>
            <p>“How are you, Franco?”</p>
            <p>“I am all right.” He sat down beside me. In a moment the blanket in front of the
                dressing station opened and two stretcher-bearers came out followed by the tall
                Englishman. He brought them over to me.</p>
            <p>“Here is the American Tenente,” he said in Italian.</p>
            <p>“I’d rather wait,” I said. “There are much worse wounded than me. I’m all right.”</p>
            <p>“Come come,” he said. “Don’t be a bloody hero.” Then in Italian: “Lift him very
                carefully about the legs. His legs are very painful. He is the legitimate son of
                President Wilson.” They picked me up and took me into the dressing room. Inside they
                were operating on all the tables. The little major looked at us furious. He
                recognized me and waved a forceps.</p>
            <p>“Ça va bien?”</p>
            <p>“Ça va.”</p>

            <pb n="63"/>

            <p>“I have brought him in,” the tall Englishman said in Italian. “The only son of the
                American Ambassador. He can be here until you are ready to take him. Then I will
                take him with my first load.” He bent over me. “I’ll look up their adjutant to do
                your papers and it will all go much faster.” He stooped to go under the doorway and
                went out. The major was unhooking the forceps now, dropping them in a basin. I
                followed his hands with my eyes. Now he was bandaging. Then the stretcher-bearers
                took the man off the table.</p>
            <p>“I’ll take the American Tenente,” one of the captains said. They lifted me onto the
                table. It was hard and slippery. There were many strong smells, chemical smells and
                the sweet smell of blood. They took off my trousers and the medical captain
                commenced dictating to the sergeant-adjutant while he worked, “Multiple superficial
                wounds of the left and right thigh and left and right knee and right foot. Profound
                wounds of right knee and foot. Lacerations of the scalp (he probed--Does that
                hurt?--Christ, yes!) with possible fracture of the skull. Incurred in the line of
                duty. That’s what keeps you from being court-martialled for self-inflicted wounds,”
                he said. “Would you like a drink of brandy ? How did you run into this thing anyway
                ? What were you trying to do? Commit suicide? Anti-tetanus please, and mark a cross
                on both legs. Thank you. I’ll clean this up a little, wash it out, and put on a
                dressing. Your blood coagulates beautifully.”</p>
            <p>The adjutant, looking up from the paper, “What inflicted the wounds ?”</p>
            <p>The medical captain, “What hit you?”</p>
            <p>Me, with the eyes shut, “A trench mortar shell.”</p>
            <p>The captain, doing things that hurt sharply and severing tissue--“Are you sure?”</p>

            <pb n="64"/>

            <p>Me--trying to lie still and feeling my stomach flutter when the flesh was cut, “I
                think so.”</p>
            <p>Captain doctor--(interested in something he was finding), “Fragments of enemy
                trench-mortar shell. Now I’ll probe for some of this if you like but it’s not
                necessary. I’ll paint all this and--Does that sting? Good, that’s nothing to how it
                will feel later. The pain hasn’t started yet. Bring him a glass of brandy. The shock
                dulls the pain; but this is all right, you have nothing to worry about if it doesn’t
                infect and it rarely does now. How is your head?”</p>
            <p>“Good Christ!” I said.</p>
            <p>“Better not drink too much brandy then. If you’ve got a fracture you don’t want
                inflammation. How does that feel?”</p>
            <p>Sweat ran all over me.</p>
            <p>“Good Christ!” I said.</p>
            <p>“I guess you’ve got a fracture all right. I’ll wrap you up and don’t bounce your head
                around.” He bandaged, his hands moving very fast and the bandage coming taut and
                sure. “All right, good luck and Vive la France.”</p>
            <p>“He’s an American,” one of the other captains said.</p>
            <p>“I thought you said he was a Frenchman. He talks French,” the captain said. “I’ve
                known him before. I always thought he was French.” He drank a half tumbler of
                cognac. “Bring on something serious. Get some more of that Anti-tetanus.” The
                captain waved to me. They lifted me and the blanket-flap went across my face as we
                went out. Outside the sergeant-adjutant knelt down beside me where I lay, “Name?” he
                asked softly. “Middle name? First name? Rank? Where born? What class? What corps?”
                and so on. “I’m <pb n="65"/> sorry for your head, Tenente. I hope you feel better.
                I’m sending you now with the English ambulance.” “I’m all right,” I said. “Thank you
                very much.” The pain that the major had spoken about had started and all that was
                happening was without interest or relation. After a while the English ambulance came
                up and they put me onto a stretcher and lifted the stretcher up to the ambulance
                level and shoved it in. There was another stretcher by the side with a man on it
                whose nose I could see, waxy-looking, out of the bandages. He breathed very heavily.
                There were stretchers lifted and slid into the slings above. The tall English driver
                came around and looked in, “I’ll take it very easily,” he said. “I hope you’ll be
                comfy.” I felt the engine start, felt him climb up into the front seat, felt the
                brake come off and the clutch go in, then we started. I lay still and let the pain
                ride.</p>
            <p>As the ambulance climbed along the road, it was slow in the traffic, sometimes it
                stopped, sometimes it backed on a turn, then finally it climbed quite fast. I felt
                something dripping. At first it dropped slowly and regularly, then it pattered into
                a stream. I shouted to the driver. He stopped the car and looked in through the hole
                behind his seat.</p>
            <p>“What is it?”</p>
            <p>“The man on the stretcher over me has a hemorrhage.”</p>
            <p>“We’re not far from the top. I wouldn’t be able to get the stretcher out alone.” He
                started the car. The stream kept on. In the dark I could not see where it came from
                the canvas overhead. I tried to move sideways so that it did not fall on me. Where
                it had run down under my shirt it was warm and sticky. I was cold and my leg hurt so
                that it made me sick. After a <pb n="66"/> while the stream from the stretcher above
                lessened and started to drip again and I heard and felt the canvas above move as the
                man on the stretcher settled more comfortably.</p>
            <p>“How is he?” the Englishman called back. “We’re almost up.”</p>
            <p>“He’s dead I think,” I said.</p>
            <p>The drops fell very slowly, as they fall from an icicle after the sun has gone. It
                was cold in the car in the night as the road climbed. At the post on the top they
                took the stretcher out and put another in and we went on.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER X</head>
            <p>In the ward at the field hospital they told me a visitor was coming to see me in the
                afternoon. It was a hot day and there were many flies in the room. My orderly had
                cut paper into strips and tied the strips to a stick to make a brush that swished
                the flies away. I watched them settle on the ceiling. When he stopped swishing and
                fell asleep they came down and I blew them away and finally covered my face with my
                hands and slept too. It was very hot and when I woke my legs itched. I waked the
                orderly and he poured mineral water on the dressings. That made the bed damp and
                cool. Those of us that were awake talked across the ward. The afternoon was a quiet
                time. In the morning they came to each bed in turn, three men nurses and a doctor
                and picked you up out of bed and carried you into the dressing room so that the beds
                could be made while we were having our wounds dressed. It was not a pleasant trip to
                the dressing room and I did not know until later that beds could be made with men in
                them. My orderly had finished pouring water and the bed felt cool and lovely and I
                was telling him where to scratch on the soles of my feet against the itching when
                one of the doctors brought in Rinaldi. He came in very fast and bent down over the
                bed and kissed me. I saw he wore gloves.</p>
            <p>“How are you, baby? How do you feel? I bring you this—-” It was a bottle of cognac.
                The orderly brought a chair and he sat down, “and good news. You will be decorated.
                They want to get you the <pb n="68"/> medaglia d’argento but perhaps they can get
                only the bronze.”</p>
            <p>“What for?”</p>
            <p>“Because you are gravely wounded. They say if you can prove you did any heroic act
                you can get the silver. Otherwise it will be the bronze. Tell me exactly what
                happened. Did you do any heroic act?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said. “I was blown up while we were eating cheese.”</p>
            <p>“Be serious. You must have done something heroic either before or after. Remember
                carefully.”</p>
            <p>“I did not.”</p>
            <p>“Didn’t you carry anybody on your back? Gordini says you carried several people on
                your back but the medical major at the first post declares it is impossible. He has
                to sign the proposition for the citation.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t carry anybody. I couldn’t move.”</p>
            <p>“That doesn’t matter,” said Rinaldi.</p>
            <p>He took off his gloves.</p>
            <p>“I think we can get you the silver. Didn’t you refuse to be medically aided before
                the others?”</p>
            <p>“Not very firmly.”</p>
            <p>“That doesn’t matter. Look how you are wounded. Look at your valorous conduct in
                asking to go always to the first line. Besides, the operation was successful.”</p>
            <p>“Did they cross the river all right?”</p>
            <p>“Enormously. They take nearly a thousand prisoners. It’s in the bulletin. Didn’t you
                see it?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll bring it to you. It is a successful coup de main.”</p>
            <p>“How is everything?”</p>
            <p>“Splendid. We are all splendid. Everybody is proud of you. Tell me just exactly how
                it happened. I am positive you will get the silver. Go on tell me. Tell me <pb
                    n="69"/> all about it.” He paused and thought. “Maybe you will get an English
                medal too. There was an English there. I’ll go and see him and ask if he will
                recommend you. He ought to be able to do something. Do you suffer much? Have a
                drink. Orderly, go get a corkscrew. Oh you should see what I did in the removal of
                three metres of small intestine and better now than ever. It is one for <hi>The
                    Lancet</hi>. You do me a translation and I will send it to <hi>The Lancet</hi>.
                Every day I am better. Poor dear baby, how do you feel ? Where is that damn
                corkscrew? You are so brave and quiet I forget you are suffering.” He slapped his
                gloves on the edge of the bed.</p>
            <p>“Here is the corkscrew, Signor Tenente,” the orderly said.</p>
            <p>“Open the bottle. Bring a glass. Drink that, baby. How is your poor head ? I looked
                at your papers. You haven’t any fracture. That major at the first post was a
                hog-butcher. I would take you and never hurt you. I never hurt anybody. I learn how
                to do it. Every day I learn to do things smoother and better. You must forgive me
                for talking so much, baby. I am very moved to see you badly wounded. There, drink
                that. It’s good. It cost fifteen lire. It ought to be good. Five stars. After I
                leave here I’ll go see that English and he’ll get you an English medal.”</p>
            <p>“They don’t give them like that.”</p>
            <p>“You are so modest. I will send the liaison officer.</p>
            <p>He can handle the English.”</p>
            <p>“Have you seen Miss Barkley?”</p>
            <p>“I will bring her here. I will go now and bring her here.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t go,” I said. “Tell me about Gorizia. How are the girls ?”</p>
            <pb n="70"/>

            <p>“There are no girls. For two weeks now they haven’t changed them. I don’t go there
                any more. It is disgraceful. They aren’t girls; they are old war comrades.”</p>
            <p>“You don’t go at all?”</p>
            <p>“1 just go to see if there is anything new. I stop by. They all ask for you. It is a
                disgrace that they should stay so long that they become friends.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe girls don’t want to go to the front any more.”</p>
            <p>“Of course they do. They have plenty of girls. It is just bad administration. They
                are keeping them for the pleasure of dugout hiders in the rear.”</p>
            <p>“Poor Rinaldi,” I said. “All alone at the war with no new girls.”</p>
            <p>Rinaldi poured himself another glass of the cognac.</p>
            <p>“I don’t think it will hurt you, baby. You take it.”</p>
            <p>I drank the cognac and felt it warm all the way down. Rinaldi poured another glass.
                He was quieter now. He held up the glass. “To your valorous wounds. To the silver
                medal. Tell me, baby, when you lie here all the time in the hot weather don’t you
                get excited?”</p>
            <p>“Sometimes.”</p>
            <p>“I can’t imagine lying like that. I would go crazy.” “You are crazy.”</p>
            <p>“I wish you were back. No one to come in at night from adventures. No one to make fun
                of. No one to lend me money. No blood brother and roommate. Why do you get yourself
                wounded?”</p>
            <p>“You can make fun of the priest.”</p>
            <p>“That priest. It isn’t me that makes fun of him. It is the captain. I like him. If
                you must have a priest have that priest. He’s coming to see you. He makes big
                preparations.”</p>
            <p>“I like him.”</p>
            <pb n="71"/>

            <p>“Oh, I knew it. Sometimes I think you and he are a little that way. You know.”</p>
            <p>“No, you don’t.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I do sometimes. A little that way like the number of the first regiment of the
                Brigata Ancona.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, go to hell.”</p>
            <p>He stood up and put on his gloves.</p>
            <p>“Oh I love to tease you, baby. With your priest and your English girl, and really you
                are just like me underneath.”</p>
            <p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, we are. You are really an Italian. All fire and smoke and nothing inside. You
                only pretend to be American. We are brothers and we love each other.”</p>
            <p>“Be good while I’m gone,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I will send Miss Barkley. You are better with her without me. You are purer and
                sweeter.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, go to hell.”</p>
            <p>“I will send her. Your lovely cool goddess. English goddess. My God what would a man
                do with a woman like that except worship her ? What else is an Englishwoman good
                for?”</p>
            <p>“You are an ignorant foul-mouthed dago.”</p>
            <p>“A what?”</p>
            <p>“An ignorant wop.”</p>
            <p>“Wop. You are a frozen-faced . . . wop.”</p>
            <p>“You are ignorant. Stupid.” I saw that word pricked him and kept on. “Uninformed.
                Inexperienced, stupid from inexperience.”</p>
            <p>“Truly? I tell you something about your good women. Your goddesses. There is only one
                difference between taking a girl who has always been good and a woman. With a girl
                it is painful. That’s all I know.” <pb n="72"/> He slapped the bed with his glove.
                “And you never know if the girl will really like it.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t get angry.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not angry. I just tell you, baby, for your own good. To save you trouble.”</p>
            <p>“That’s the only difference ?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. But millions of fools like you don’t know it.”</p>
            <p>“You were sweet to tell me.”</p>
            <p>“We won’t quarrel, baby. I love you too much. But don’t be a fool.”</p>
            <p>“No. I’ll be wise like you.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t be angry, baby. Laugh. Take a drink. I must go, really.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a good old boy.”</p>
            <p>“Now you see. Underneath we are the same. We are war brothers. Kiss me good-by.”</p>
            <p>“You’re sloppy.”</p>
            <p>“No. I am just more affectionate.”</p>
            <p>I felt his breath come toward me. “Good-by. I come to see you again soon.” His breath
                went away. “I won’t kiss you if you don’t want. I’ll send your English girl.
                Good-by, baby. The cognac is under the bed. Get well soon.”</p>
            <p>He was gone.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
            <p>It was dusk when the priest came. They had brought the soup and afterward taken away
                the bowls and I was lying looking at the rows of beds and out the window at the
                tree-top that moved a little in the evening breeze. The breeze came in through the
                window and it was cooler with the evening. The flies were on the ceiling now and on
                the electric light bulbs that hung on wires. The lights were only turned on when
                some one was brought in at night or when something was being done. It made me feel
                very young to have the dark come after the dusk and then remain. It was like being
                put to bed after early supper. The orderly came down between the beds and stopped.
                Some one was with him. It was the priest. He stood there small, brown-faced, and
                embarrassed.</p>
            <p>“How do you do ?” he asked. He put some packages down by the bed, on the floor.</p>
            <p>“All right, father.”</p>
            <p>He sat down in the chair that had been brought for Rinaldi and looked out of the
                window embarrassedly. I noticed his face looked very tired.</p>
            <p>“I can only stay a minute,” he said. “It is late.” “It’s not late. How is the
                mess?”</p>
            <p>He smiled. “I am still a great joke,” he sounded tired too. “Thank God they are all
                well.”</p>
            <p>“I am so glad you are all right,” he said. “I hope you don’t suffer.” He seemed very
                tired and I was not used to seeing him tired.</p>
            <p>“Not any more.”</p>
            <p>“I miss you at the mess.”</p>

            <pb n="74"/>
            <p>“I wish I were there. I always enjoyed our talking.”</p>
            <p>“I brought you a few little things,” he said. He picked up the packages. “This is
                mosquito netting. This is a bottle of vermouth. You like vermouth? These are English
                papers.”</p>
            <p>“Please open them.”</p>
            <p>He was pleased and undid them. I held the mosquito netting in my hands. The vermouth
                he held up for me to see and then put it on the floor beside the bed. I held up one
                of the sheaf of English papers. I could read the headlines by turning it so the
                half-light from the window was on it. It was <hi>The News of the World</hi>.</p>
            <p>“The others are illustrated,” he said.</p>
            <p>“It will be a great happiness to read them. Where did you get them?”</p>
            <p>“I sent for them to Mestre. I will have more.”</p>
            <p>“You were very good to come, father. Will you drink a glass of vermouth?”</p>
            <p>“Thank you. You keep it. It’s for you.”</p>
            <p>“No, drink a glass.”</p>
            <p>“All right. I will bring you more then.”</p>
            <p>The orderly brought the glasses and opened the bottle. He broke off the cork and the
                end had to be shoved down into the bottle. I could see the priest was disappointed
                but he said, “That’s all right. It’s no matter.”</p>
            <p>“Here’s to your health, father.”</p>
            <p>“To your better health.”</p>
            <p>Afterward he held the glass in his hand and we looked at one another. Sometimes we
                talked and were good friends but to-night it was difficult.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter, father? You seem very tired.</p>
            <p>“I am tired but I have no right to be.”</p>

            <pb n="75"/>
            <p>“It’s the heat.”</p>
            <p>“No. This is only the Spring. I feel very low.”</p>
            <p>“You have the war disgust.”</p>
            <p>“No. But I hate the war.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t enjoy it,” I said. He shook his head and looked out of the window.</p>
            <p>“You do not mind it. You do not see it. You must forgive me. I know you are
                wounded.”</p>
            <p>“That is an accident.”</p>
            <p>“Still even wounded you do not see it. I can tell. I do not see it myself but I feel
                it a little.”</p>
            <p>“When I was wounded we were talking about it. Passini was talking.”</p>
            <p>The priest put down the glass. He was thinking about something else.</p>
            <p>“I know them because I am like they are,” he said.</p>
            <p>“You are different though.”</p>
            <p>“But really I am like they are.”</p>
            <p>“The officers don’t see anything.”</p>
            <p>“Some of them do. Some are very delicate and feel worse than any of us.”</p>
            <p>“They are mostly different.”</p>
            <p>“It is not education or money. It is something else. Even if they had education or
                money men like Passini would not wish to be officers. I would not be an
                officer.”</p>
            <p>“You rank as an officer. I am an officer.”</p>
            <p>“I am not really. You are not even an Italian. You are a foreigner. But you are
                nearer the officers than you are to the men.”</p>
            <p>“What is the difference?”</p>
            <p>“I cannot say it easily. There are people who would make war. In this country there
                are many like that. There are other people who would not make war.”</p>

            <pb n="76"/>

            <p>“But the first ones make them do it.”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“And I help them.”</p>
            <p>“You are a foreigner. You are a patriot.”</p>
            <p>“And the ones who would not make war? Can they stop it?”</p>
            <p>“I do not know.”</p>
            <p>He looked out of the window again. I watched his face.</p>
            <p>“Have they ever been able to stop it?”</p>
            <p>“They are not organized to stop things and when they get organized their leaders sell
                them out.”</p>
            <p>“Then it’s hopeless?”</p>
            <p>“It is never hopeless. But sometimes I cannot hope.</p>
            <p>I try always to hope but sometimes I cannot.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe the war will be over.”</p>
            <p>“I hope so.”</p>
            <p>“What will you do then?”</p>
            <p>“If it is possible I will return to the Abruzzi.”</p>
            <p>His brown face was suddenly very happy.</p>
            <p>“You love the Abruzzi!”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I love it very much.”</p>
            <p>“You ought to go there then.”</p>
            <p>“I would be too happy. If I could live there and love God and serve Him.”</p>
            <p>“And be respected,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Yes and be respected. Why not?”</p>
            <p>“No reason not. You should be respected.”</p>
            <p>“It does not matter. But there in my country it is understood that a man may love
                God. It is not a dirty joke.”</p>
            <p>“I understand.”</p>
            <p>He looked at me and smiled.</p>
            <p>“You understand but you do not love God.”</p>

            <pb n="77"/>

            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“You do not love Him at all ?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“I am afraid of him in the night sometimes.”</p>
            <p>“You should love Him.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t love much.”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” he said. “You do. What you tell me about in the nights. That is not love. That
                is only passion and lust. When you love you wish to do things for. You wish to
                sacrifice for. You wish to serve.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t love.”</p>
            <p>“You will. I know you will. Then you will be happy.”</p>
            <p>“I’m happy. I’ve always been happy.”</p>
            <p>“It is another thing. You cannot know about it unless you have it.”</p>
            <p>“Well,” I said. “If I ever get it I will tell you.”</p>
            <p>“I stay too long and talk too much.” He was worried that he really did.</p>
            <p>“No. Don’t go. How about loving women? If I really loved some woman would it be like
                that?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know about that. I never loved any woman.”</p>
            <p>“What about your mother?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I must have loved my mother.”</p>
            <p>“Did you always love God?”</p>
            <p>“Ever since I was a little boy.”</p>
            <p>“Well,” I said. I did not know what to say. “You are a fine boy,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I am a boy,” he said. “But you call me father.”</p>
            <p>“That’s politeness.”</p>
            <p>He smiled.</p>
            <p>“I must go, really,” he said. “You do not want me for anything?” he asked
                hopefully.</p>
            <p>“No. Just to talk.”</p>
            <p>“I will take your greetings to the mess.”</p>

            <pb n="78"/>
            <p>“Thank you for the many fine presents.”</p>
            <p>“Nothing.”</p>
            <p>“Come and see me again.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. Good-by,” he patted my hand.</p>
            <p>“So long,” I said in dialect.</p>
            <p>“Ciaou,” he repeated.</p>
            <p>It was dark in the room and the orderly, who had sat by the foot of the bed, got up
                and went out with him. I liked him very much and I hoped he would get back to the
                Abruzzi some time. He had a rotten life in the mess and he was fine about it but I
                thought how he would be in his own country. At Capracotta, he had told me, there
                were trout in the stream below the town. It was forbidden to play the flute at
                night. When the young men serenaded only the flute was forbidden. Why, I had asked.
                Because it was bad for the girls to hear the flute at night. The peasants all called
                you “Don” and when you met them they took off their hats. His father hunted every
                day and stopped to eat at the houses of peasants. They were always honored. For a
                foreigner to hunt he must present a certificate that he had never been arrested.
                There were bears on the Gran Sasso D'Italia but it was a long way. Aquila was a fine
                town. It was cool in the summer at night and the spring in Abruzzi was the most
                beautiful in Italy. But what was lovely was the fall to go hunting through the
                chestnut woods. The birds were all good because they fed on grapes and you never
                took a lunch because the peasants were always honored if you would eat with them at
                their houses. After a while I went to sleep.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
            <p>The room was long with windows on the right-hand side and a door at the far end that
                went into the dressing room. The row of beds that mine was in faced the windows and
                another row, under the windows, faced the wall. If you lay on your left side you
                could see the dressing-room door. There was another door at the far end that people
                sometimes came in by. If any one were going to die they put a screen around the bed
                so you could not see them die, but only the shoes and puttees of doctors and men
                nurses showed under the bottom of the screen and sometimes at the end there would be
                whispering. Then the priest would come out from behind the screen and afterward the
                men nurses would go back behind the screen to come out again carrying the one who
                was dead with a blanket over him down the corridor between the beds and some one
                folded the screen and took it away.</p>
            <p>That morning the major in charge of the ward asked me if I felt that I could travel
                the next day. I said I could. He said then they would ship me out early in the
                morning. He said I would be better off making the trip now before it got too
                hot.</p>
            <p>When they lifted you up out of bed to carry you into the dressing room you could look
                out of the window and see the new graves in the garden. A soldier sat outside the
                door that opened onto the garden making crosses and painting on them the names,
                rank, and regiment of the men who were buried in the garden. He also ran errands for
                the ward and in his spare time made me a cigarette lighter out of an empty Austrian
                    <pb n="80"/> rifle cartridge. The doctors were very nice and seemed very
                capable. They were anxious to ship me to Milan where there were better X-ray
                facilities and where, after the operation, I could take mechano-therapy. I wanted to
                go to Milan too. They wanted to get us all out and back as far as possible because
                all the beds were needed for the offensive, when it should start.</p>
            <p>The night before I left the field hospital Rinaldi came in to see me with the major
                from our mess. They said that I would go to an American hospital in Milan that had
                just been installed. Some American ambulance units were to be sent down and this
                hospital would look after them and any other Americans on service in Italy. There
                were many in the Red Cross. The States had declared war on Germany but not on
                Austria.</p>
            <p>The Italians were sure America would declare war on Austria too and they were very
                excited about any Americans coming down, even the Red Cross. They asked me if I
                thought President Wilson would declare war on Austria and I said it was only a
                matter of days. I did not know what we had against Austria but it seemed logical
                that they should declare war on her if they did on Germany. They asked me if we
                would declare war on Turkey. I said that was doubtful. Turkey, I said, was our
                national bird but the joke translated so badly and they were so puzzled and
                suspicious that I said yes, we would probably declare war on Turkey. And on
                Bulgaria? We had drunk several glasses of brandy and I said yes by God on Bulgaria
                too and on Japan. But, they said, Japan is an ally of England. You can’t trust the
                bloody English. The Japanese want Hawaii, I said. Where is Hawaii ? It is in the
                Pacific Ocean. Why do the Japanese want it? They don’t really want it, I said. That
                is all talk. The Japanese are a <pb n="81"/> wonderful little people fond of dancing
                and light wines. Like the French, said the major. We will get Nice and Savoia from
                the French. We will get Corsica and all the Adriatic coast-line, Rinaldi said. Italy
                will return to the splendors of Rome, said the major. I don’t like Rome, I said. It
                is hot and full of fleas. You don’t like Rome? Yes, I love Rome. Rome is the mother
                of nations. I will never forget Romulus suckling the Tiber. What? Nothing. Let’s all
                go to Rome. Let’s go to Rome to-night and never come back. Rome is a beautiful city,
                said the major. The mother and father of nations, I said. Roma is feminine, said
                Rinaldi. It cannot be the father. Who is the father, then, the Holy Ghost ? Don’t
                blaspheme. I wasn’t blaspheming, I was asking for information. You are drunk, baby.
                Who made me drunk? I made you drunk, said the major. I made you drunk because I love
                you and because America is in the war. Up to the hilt, I said. You go away in the
                morning, baby, Rinaldi said. To Rome, I said. No, to Milan. To Milan, said the
                major, to the Crystal Palace, to the Cova, to Campari’s, to Biffi’s, to the
                galleria. You lucky boy. To the Gran Italia I said, where I will borrow money from
                George. To the Scala, said Rinaldi. You will go to the Scala. Every night, I said.
                You won’t be able to afford it every night, said the major.</p>
            <p>The tickets are very expensive. I will draw a sight draft on my grandfather, I said.
                A what? A sight draft. He has to pay or I go to jail. Mr. Cunningham at the bank
                does it. I live by sight drafts. Can a grandfather jail a patriotic grandson who is
                dying that Italy may live? Live the American Garibaldi, said Rinaldi. Viva the sight
                drafts, I said. We must be quiet, said the major. Already we have been asked many
                times to <pb n="82"/> be quiet. Do you go to-morrow really, Federico? He goes to the
                American hospital I tell you, Rinaldi said. To the beautiful nurses. Not the nurses
                with beards of the field hospital. Yes, yes, said the major, I know he goes to the
                American hospital. I don’t mind their beards, I said. If any man wants to raise a
                beard let him. Why don’t you raise a beard, Signor Maggiore? It could not go in a
                gas mask. Yes it could. Anything can go in a gas mask. I’ve vomited into a gas mask.
                Don’t be so loud, baby, Rinaldi said. We all know you have been at the front. Oh,
                you fine baby, what will I do while you are gone? We must go, said the major. This
                becomes sentimental. Listen, I have a surprise for you. Your English. You know? The
                English you go to see every night at their hospital ? She is going to Milan too. She
                goes with another to be at the American hospital. They had not got nurses yet from
                America. I talked to-day with the head of their riparto. They have too many women
                here at the front. They send some back. How do you like that, baby? All right. Yes?
                You go to live in a big city and have your English there to cuddle you. Why don’t I
                get wounded? Maybe you will, I said. We must go, said the major. We drink and make
                noise and disturb Federico. Don’t go. Yes, we must go. Good-by. Good luck. Many
                things. Ciaou. Ciaou. Ciaou. Come back quickly, baby. Rinaldi kissed me. You smell
                of lysol. Good-by, baby. Good-by. Many things. The major patted my shoulder. They
                tiptoed out. I found I was quite drunk but went to sleep.</p>
            <p>The next day in the morning we left for Milan and arrived forty-eight hours later. It
                was a bad trip. We were sidetracked for a long time this side of Mestre <pb n="83"/>
                and children came and peeked in. I got a little boy to go for a bottle of cognac but
                he came back and said he could only get grappa. I told him to get it and when it
                came I gave him the change and the man beside me and I got drunk and slept until
                past Vicenza where I woke up and was very sick on the floor. It did not matter
                because the man on that side had been very sick on the floor several times before.
                Afterward I thought I could not stand the thirst and in the yards outside of Verona
                I called to a soldier who was walking up and down beside the train and he got me a
                drink of water. I woke Georgetti, the other boy who was drunk, and offered him some
                water. He said to pour it on his shoulder and went back to sleep. The soldier would
                not take the penny I offered him and brought me a pulpy orange. I sucked on that and
                spit out the pith and watched the soldier pass up and down past a freight-car
                outside and after a while the train gave a jerk and started.</p>

            <p>We got into Milan early in the morning and they unloaded us in the freight yard. An
                ambulance took me to the American hospital. Riding in the ambulance on a stretcher I
                could not tell what part of town we were passing through but when they unloaded the
                stretcher I saw a market-place and an open wine shop with a girl sweeping out. They
                were watering the street and it smelled of the early morning. They put the stretcher
                down and went in. The porter came out with them. He had gray mustaches, wore a
                doorman’s cap and was in his shirt sleeves. The stretcher would not go into the
                elevator and they discussed whether it was better to lift me off the stretcher and
                go up in the elevator or carry the stretcher up the stairs. I listened to them
                discussing it. They decided on the elevator. They lifted me from the stretcher. “Go
                easy,” I said. “Take it softly.”</p>
            <p>In the elevator we were crowded and as my legs bent the pain was very bad.
                “Straighten out the legs,” I said.</p>
            <p>“We can’t, Signor Tenente. There isn’t room.” The man who said this had his arm
                around me and my arm was around his neck. His breath came in my face metallic with
                garlic and red wine.</p>
            <p>“Be gentle,” the other man said.</p>
            <p>“Son of a bitch who isn’t gentle!”</p>
            <p>“Be gentle I say,” the man with my feet repeated.</p>
            <p>I saw the doors of the elevator closed, and the grill shut and the fourth-floor
                button pushed by the porter. <pb n="88"/> The porter looked worried. The elevator
                rose slowly.</p>
            <p>“Heavy?” I asked the man with the garlic.</p>
            <p>“Nothing,” he said. His face was sweating and he grunted. The elevator rose steadily
                and stopped. The man holding the feet opened the door and stepped out. We were on a
                balcony. There were several doors with brass knobs. The man carrying the feet pushed
                a button that rang a bell. We heard it inside the doors. No one came. Then the
                porter came up the stairs.</p>
            <p>“Where are they?” the stretcher-bearers asked.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know,” said the porter. “They sleep down stairs.”</p>
            <p>“Get somebody.”</p>
            <p>The porter rang the bell, then knocked on the door, then he opened the door and went
                in. When he came back there was an elderly woman wearing glasses with him. Her hair
                was loose and half-falling and she wore a nurse’s dress.</p>
            <p>“I can’t understand,” she said. “I can’t understand Italian.”</p>
            <p>“I can speak English,” I said. “They want to put me somewhere.”</p>
            <p>“None of the rooms are ready. There isn’t any patient expected.” She tucked at her
                hair and looked at me near-sightedly.</p>
            <p>“Show them any room where they can put me.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know,” she said. “There’s no patient expected. I couldn’t put you in just
                any room.”</p>
            <p>“Any room will do,” I said. Then to the porter in Italian, “Find an empty room.”</p>
            <p>“They are all empty,” said the porter. “You are the first patient.” He held his cap
                in his hand and looked at the elderly nurse.</p>
            <p>For Christ’s sweet sake take me to some room. <pb n="89"/> The pain had gone on and
                on with the legs bent and I could feel it going in and out of the bone. The porter
                went in the door, followed by the gray-haired woman, then came hurrying back.
                “Follow me,” he said. They carried me down a long hallway and into a room with drawn
                blinds. It smelled of new furniture. There was a bed and a big wardrobe with a
                mirror. They laid me down on the bed.</p>
            <p>“I can’t put on sheets,” the woman said. “The sheets are locked up.”</p>
            <p>I did not speak to her. “There is money in my pocket,” I said to the porter. “In the
                buttoned-down pocket.” The porter took out the money. The two stretcher-bearers
                stood beside the bed holding their caps. “Give them five lire apiece and five lire
                for yourself. My papers are in the other pocket You may give them to the nurse.”</p>
            <p>The stretcher-bearers saluted and said thank you. “Good-by,” I said. “And many
                thanks.” They saluted again and went out.</p>
            <p>“Those papers,” I said to the nurse, “describe my case and the treatment already
                given.”</p>
            <p>The woman picked them up and looked at them through her glasses. There were three
                papers and they were folded. “I don’t know what to do,” she said. “I can’t read
                Italian. I can’t do anything without the doctor’s orders.” She commenced to cry and
                put the papers in her apron pocket. “Are you an American?” she asked crying.</p>
            <p>“Yes. Please put the papers on the table by the bed.”</p>
            <p>It was dim and cool in the room. As I lay on the bed I could see the big mirror on
                the other side of the room but could not see what it reflected. The porter stood by
                the bed. He had a nice face and was very kind.</p>

            <pb n="90"/>
            <p>“You can go,” I said to him. “You can go too,” I said to the nurse. “What is your
                name?”</p>
            <p>“Mrs. Walker.”</p>
            <p>“You can go, Mrs. Walker. I think I will go to sleep.”</p>
            <p>I was alone in the room. It was cool and did not smell like a hospital. The mattress
                was firm and comfortable and I lay without moving, hardly breathing, happy in
                feeling the pain lessen. After a while I wanted a drink of water and found the bell
                on a cord by the bed and rang it but nobody came. I went to sleep.</p>
            <p>When I woke I looked around. There was sunlight coming in through the shutters. I saw
                the big armoire, the bare walls, and two chairs. My legs in the dirty bandages,
                stuck straight out in the bed. I was careful not to move them. I was thirsty and I
                reached for the bell and pushed the button. I heard the door open and looked and it
                was a nurse. She looked young and pretty.</p>
            <p>“Good-morning,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Good-morning,” she said and came over to the bed. “We haven’t been able to get the
                doctor. He’s gone to Lake Como. No one knew there was a patient coming. What’s wrong
                with you anyway?”</p>
            <p>“I’m wounded. In the legs and feet and my head is hurt.”</p>
            <p>“What’s your name?”</p>
            <p>“Henry. Frederic Henry.”</p>
            <p>I’ll wash you up. But we can’t do anything to the dressings until the doctor
                comes.”</p>
            <p>“Is Miss Barkley here?”</p>
            <p>“No. There’s no one by that name here.”</p>
            <p>“Who was the woman who cried when I came in?”</p>
            <p>The nurse laughed. “That’s Mrs. Walker. She was <pb n="91"/> on night duty and she’d
                been asleep. She wasn’t expecting any one.”</p>
            <p>While we were talking she was undressing me, and when I was undressed, except for the
                bandages, she washed me, very gently and smoothly. The washing felt very good. There
                was a bandage on my head but she washed all around the edge.</p>
            <p>“Where were you wounded?”</p>
            <p>“On the Isonzo north of Plava.”</p>
            <p>“Where is that?”</p>
            <p>“North of Gorizia.”</p>
            <p>I could see that none of the places meant anything to her.</p>
            <p>“Do you have a lot of pain?”</p>
            <p>“No. Not much now.”</p>
            <p>She put a thermometer in my mouth.</p>
            <p>“The Italians put it under the arm,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Don’t talk.”</p>
            <p>When she took the thermometer out she read it and then shook it.</p>
            <p>“What’s the temperature?”</p>
            <p>“You’re not supposed to know that.”</p>
            <p>“Tell me what it is.”</p>
            <p>“It’s almost normal.”</p>
            <p>“I never have any fever. My legs are full of old iron too.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“They’re full of trench-mortar fragments, old screws and bed-springs and things.”</p>
            <p>She shook her head and smiled.</p>
            <p>“If you had any foreign bodies in your legs they would set up an inflammation and
                you’d have fever.”</p>
            <p>“All right,” I said. “We’ll see what comes out.”</p>
            <p>She went out of the room and came back with the <pb n="92"/> old nurse of the early
                morning. Together they made the bed with me in it. That was new to me and an
                admirable proceeding.</p>
            <p>“Who is in charge here?”</p>
            <p>“Miss Van Campen.”</p>
            <p>“How many nurses are there ?”</p>
            <p>“Just us two.”</p>
            <p>“Won’t there be more?”</p>
            <p>“Some more are coming.”</p>
            <p>“When will they get here ?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. You ask a great many questions for a sick boy.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not sick,” I said, “I’m wounded.”</p>
            <p>They had finished making the bed and I lay with a clean smooth sheet under me and
                another sheet over me. Mrs. Walker went out and came back with a pajama jacket They
                put that on me and I felt very clean and dressed.</p>
            <p>“You’re awfully nice to me,” I said. The nurse called Miss Gage giggled. “Could I
                have a drink of water?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“Certainly. Then you can have breakfast.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t want breakfast. Can I have the shutters opened please ?”</p>
            <p>The light had been dim in the room and when the shutters were opened it was bright
                sunlight and I looked out on a balcony and beyond were the tile roofs of houses and
                chimneys. I looked out over the tiled roofs and saw white clouds and the sky very
                blue.</p>
            <p>“Don’t you know when the other nurses are coming?”</p>
            <p>“Why? Don’t we take good care of you?” “You’re very nice.”</p>
            <p>Would you like to use the bedpan ?”</p>

            <pb n="93"/>

            <p>“I might try.”</p>
            <p>They helped me and held me up but it was not any use. Afterward I lay and looked out
                the open doors onto the balcony.</p>
            <p>“When does the doctor come?”</p>
            <p>“When he gets back. We’ve tried to telephone to Lake Como for him.”</p>
            <p>“Aren’t there any other doctors ?”</p>
            <p>“He’s the doctor for the hospital.”</p>
            <p>Miss Gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass. I drank three glasses and then they
                left me and I looked out the window a while and went back to sleep. I ate some lunch
                and in the afternoon Miss Van Campen, the superintendent, came up to see me. She did
                not like me and I did not like her. She was small and neatly suspicious and too good
                for her position. She asked many questions and seemed to think it was somewhat
                disgraceful that I was with the Italians.</p>
            <p>“Can I have wine with the meals ?” I asked her.</p>
            <p>“Only if the doctor prescribes it.”</p>
            <p>“I can’t have it until he comes?”</p>
            <p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
            <p>“You plan on having him come eventually?”</p>
            <p>“We’ve telephoned him at Lake Como.” She went out and Miss Gage came back.</p>
            <p>“Why were you rude to Miss Van Campen?” she asked after she had done something for me
                very skilfully.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t mean to be. But she was snooty.”</p>
            <p>“She said you were domineering and rude.”</p>
            <p>“I wasn’t. But what’s the idea of a hospital without a doctor?”</p>
            <p>“He’s coming. They’ve telephoned for him to Lake Como.”</p>

            <pb n="94"/>

            <p>“What does he do there ? Swim ?”</p>
            <p>“No. He has a clinic there.”</p>
            <p>“Why don’t they get another doctor?”</p>
            <p>“Hush. Hush. Be a good boy and he’ll come.”</p>
            <p>I sent for the porter and when he came I told him in Italian to get me a bottle of
                Cinzano at the wine shop, a fiasco of chianti and the evening papers. He went away
                and brought them wrapped in newspaper, unwrapped them and, when I asked him to, drew
                the corks and put the wine and vermouth under the bed. They left me alone and I lay
                in bed and read the papers awhile, the news from the front, and the list of dead
                officers with their decorations and then reached down and brought up the bottle of
                Cinzano and held it straight up on my stomach, the cool glass against my stomach,
                and took little drinks making rings on my stomach from holding the bottle there
                between drinks, and watched it get dark outside over the roofs of the town. The
                swallows circled around and I watched them and the night-hawks flying above the
                roofs and drank the Cinzano. Miss Gage brought up a glass with some egg-nog in it. I
                lowered the vermouth bottle to the other side of the bed when she came in.</p>
            <p>“Miss Van Campen had some sherry put in this,” she said. “You shouldn’t be rude to
                her. She’s not young and this hospital is a big responsibility for her. Mrs.
                Walker’s too old and she’s no use to her.”</p>
            <p>“She’s a splendid woman,” I said. “Thank her very much.”</p>
            <p>I'm going to bring your supper right away.”</p>
            <p>“That’s all right,” I said. “I’m not hungry.”</p>
            <p>When she brought the tray and put it on the bed table I thanked her and ate a little
                of the supper. Afterward it was dark outside and I could see the beams of <pb n="95"
                /> the search-lights moving in the sky. I watched for a while and then went to
                sleep. I slept heavily except once I woke sweating and scared and then went back to
                sleep trying to stay outside of my dream. I woke for good long before it was light
                and heard roosters crowing and stayed on awake until it began to be light. I was
                tired and once it was really light I went back to sleep again.</p>

            <p>It was bright sunlight in the room when I woke. I thought I was back at the front and
                stretched out in bed. My legs hurt me and I looked down at them still in the dirty
                bandages, and seeing them knew where I was. I reached up for the bell-cord and
                pushed the button. I heard it buzz down the hall and then some one coming on rubber
                soles along the hall. It was Miss Gage and she looked a little older in the bright
                sunlight and not so pretty.</p>
            <p>“Good morning,” she said. “Did you have a good night ?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. Thanks very much,” I said. “Can I have a barber ?”</p>
            <p>“I came in to see you and you were asleep with this in the bed with you.”</p>
            <p>She opened the armoire door and held up the vermouth bottle. It was nearly empty. “I
                put the other bottle from under the bed in there too,” she said. “Why didn’t you ask
                me for a glass?”</p>
            <p>“I thought maybe you wouldn’t let me have it.”</p>
            <p>“I’d have had some with you.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a fine girl.”</p>
            <p>“It isn’t good for you to drink alone,” she said. “You mustn’t do it.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“Your friend Miss Barkley’s come,” she said.</p>
            <p>“Really?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. I don’t like her.”</p>
            <p>“You will like her. She’s awfully nice.”</p>


            <pb n="97"/>

            <p>She shook her head. “I’m sure she’s fine. Can you move just a little to this side?
                That’s fine. I’ll clean you up for breakfast.” She washed me with a cloth and soap
                and warm water. “Hold your shoulder up,” she said. “That’s fine.”</p>
            <p>“Can I have the barber before breakfast?”</p>
            <p>“I’ll send the porter for him.” She went out and came back. “He’s gone for him,” she
                said and dipped the cloth she held in the basin of water.</p>
            <p>The barber came with the porter. He was a man of about fifty with an upturned
                mustache. Miss Gage was finished with me and went out and the barber lathered my
                face and shaved. He was very solemn and refrained from talking.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter ? Don’t you know any news ?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“What news?”</p>
            <p>“Any news. What’s happened in the town?”</p>
            <p>“It is time of war,” he said. “The enemy’s ears are everywhere.”</p>
            <p>I looked up at him. “Please hold your face still,” he said and went on shaving. “I
                will tell nothing.”</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter with you?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“I am an Italian. I will not communicate with the enemy.”</p>
            <p>I let it go at that. If he was crazy, the sooner I could get out from under the razor
                the better. Once I tried to get a good look at him. “Beware,” he said. “The razor is
                sharp.”</p>
            <p>I paid him when it was over and tipped him half a lira. He returned the coins.</p>
            <p>“I will not. I am not at the front. But I am an Italian.”</p>
            <p>“Get the hell out of here.”</p>


            <pb n="98"/>

            <p>“With your permission,” he said and wrapped his razors in newspaper. He went out
                leaving the five copper coins on the table beside the bed. I rang the bell. Miss
                Gage came in. “Would you ask the porter to come please?”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>The porter came in. He was trying to keep from laughing.</p>
            <p>“Is that barber crazy?”</p>
            <p>“No, signorino. He made a mistake. He doesn’t understand very well and he thought I
                said you were an Austrian officer.”</p>
            <p>“Oh,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Ho ho ho,” the porter laughed. “He was funny. One move from you he said and he would
                have--” he drew his forefinger across his throat.</p>
            <p>“Ho ho ho,” he tried to keep from laughing. “When I tell him you were not an
                Austrian. Ho ho ho.”</p>
            <p>“Ho ho ho,” I said bitterly. “How funny if he would cut my throat. Ho ho ho.”</p>
            <p>“No, signorino. No, no. He was so frightened of an Austrian. Ho ho ho.”</p>
            <p>“Ho ho ho,” I said. “Get out of here.”</p>
            <p>He went out and I heard him laughing in the hall. I heard some one coming down the
                hallway. I looked toward the door. It was Catherine Barkley.</p>
            <p>She came in the room and over to the bed.</p>
            <p>“Hello, darling,” she said. She looked fresh and young and very beautiful. I thought
                I had never seen any one so beautiful.</p>
            <p>“Hello,” I said. When I saw her I was in love with her. Everything turned over inside
                of me. She looked toward the door, saw there was no one, then she <pb n="99"/> sat
                on the side of the bed and leaned over and kissed me. I pulled her down and kissed
                her and felt her heart beating.</p>
            <p>“You sweet,” I said. “Weren’t you wonderful to come here?”</p>
            <p>“It wasn’t very hard. It may be hard to stay.”</p>
            <p>“You’ve got to stay,” I said. “Oh, you’re wonderful.” I was crazy about her. I could
                not believe she was really there and held her tight to me.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>“You mustn’t,” she said. “You’re not well enough.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I am. Come on.”</p>
            <p>“No. You’re not strong enough.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. I am. Yes. Please.”</p>
            <p>“You do love me?”</p>
            <p>“I really love you. I’m crazy about you. Come on please.”</p>
            <p>“Feel our hearts beating.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t care about our hearts. I want you. I’m just mad about you.”</p>
            <p>“You really love me?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t keep on saying that. Come on. Please. Please, Catherine.”</p>
            <p>“All right but only for a minute.”</p>
            <p>“All right,” I said. “Shut the door.”</p>
            <p>“You can’t. You shouldn’t”</p>
            <p>“Come on. Don’t talk. Please come on.”</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Catherine sat in a chair by the bed. The door was open into the hall. The wildness
                was gone and I felt finer than I had ever felt.</p>
            <p>She asked, “Now do you believe I love you ?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, you’re lovely,” I said. “You’ve got to stay. They can’t send you away. I’m crazy
                in love with you.”</p>

            <pb n="100"/>

            <p>“We’ll have to be awfully careful. That was just madness. We can’t do that.”</p>
            <p>“We can at night.”</p>
            <p>“We’ll have to be awfully careful. You’ll have to be careful in front of other
                people.”</p>
            <p>“I will.”</p>
            <p>“You’ll have to be. You’re sweet. You do love me, don’t you?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t say that again. You don’t know what that does to me.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll be careful then. I don’t want to do anything more to you. I have to go now,
                darling, really.”</p>
            <p>“Come back right away.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll come when I can.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by, sweet.”</p>
            <p>She went out. God knows I had not wanted to fall in love with her. I had not wanted
                to fall in love with any one. But God knows I had and I lay on the bed in the room
                of the hospital in Milan and all sorts of things went through my head but I felt
                wonderful and finally Miss Gage came in.</p>
            <p>“The doctor’s coming,” she said. “He telephoned from Lake Como.”</p>
            <p>“When does he get here?”</p>
            <p>“He’ll be here this afternoon.”</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XV</head>

            <p>Nothing happened until afternoon. The doctor was a thin quiet little man who seemed
                disturbed by the war. He took out a number of small steel splinters from my thighs
                with delicate and refined distaste. He used a local anaesthetic called something or
                other “snow,” which froze the tissue and avoided pain until the probe, the scalpel
                or the forceps got below the frozen portion. The anaesthetized area was clearly
                defined by the patient and after a time the doctor’s fragile delicacy was exhausted
                and he said it would be better to have an X-ray. Probing was unsatisfactory, he
                said.</p>
            <p>The X-ray was taken at the Ospedale Maggiore and the doctor who did it was excitable,
                efficient and cheerful. It was arranged by holding up the shoulders, that the
                patient should see personally some of the larger foreign bodies through the machine.
                The plates were to be sent over. The doctor requested me to write in his pocket
                notebook, my name, and regiment and some sentiment. He declared that the foreign
                bodies were ugly, nasty, brutal. The Austrians were sons of bitches. How many had I
                killed? I had not killed any but I was anxious to please—and I said I had killed
                plenty. Miss Gage was with me and the doctor put his arm around her and said she was
                more beautiful than Cleopatra. Did she understand that? Cleopatra the former queen
                of Egypt. Yes, by God she was. We returned to the little hospital in the ambulance
                and after a while and much lifting I was upstairs and in bed again. The plates came
                that afternoon, the doctor had said by God he would have them that afternoon and he
                    <pb n="102"/> did. Catherine Barkley showed them to me. They were in red
                envelopes and she took them out of the envelopes and held them up to the light and
                we both looked.</p>
            <p>“That’s your right leg,” she said, then put the plate back in the envelope. “This is
                your left.”</p>
            <p>“Put them away,” I said, “and come over to the bed.”</p>
            <p>“I can’t,” she said. “I just brought them in for a second to show you.”</p>
            <p>She went out and I lay there. It was a hot afternoon and I was sick of lying in bed.
                I sent the porter for the papers, all the papers he could get.</p>
            <p>Before he came back three doctors came into the room. I have noticed that doctors who
                fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to seek one another’s company and
                aid in consultation. A doctor who cannot take out your appendix properly will
                recommend to you a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils with success.
                These were three such doctors.</p>
            <p>“This is the young man,” said the house doctor with the delicate hands.</p>
            <p>“How do you do?” said the tall gaunt doctor with the beard. The third doctor, who
                carried the X-ray plates in their red envelopes, said nothing.</p>
            <p>“Remove the dressings?” questioned the bearded doctor.</p>
            <p>“Certainly. Remove the dressings, please, nurse,” the house doctor said to Miss Gage.
                Miss Gage removed the dressings. I looked down at the legs. At the field hospital
                they had the look of not too freshly ground hamburger steak. Now they were crusted
                and the knee was swollen and discolored and the calf sunken but there was no
                pus.</p>

            <pb n="103"/>
            <p>“Very clean,” said the house doctor. “Very clean and nice.”</p>
            <p>“Um,” said the doctor with the beard. The third doctor looked over the house doctor’s
                shoulder.</p>
            <p>“Please move the knee,” said the bearded doctor.</p>
            <p>“I can’t.”</p>
            <p>“Test the articulation?” the bearded doctor questioned. He had a stripe beside the
                three stars on his sleeve. That meant he was a first captain.</p>
            <p>“Certainly,” the house doctor said. Two of them took hold of my right leg very
                gingerly and bent it.</p>
            <p>“That hurts,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Yes. Yes. A little further, doctor.”</p>
            <p>“That’s enough. That’s as far as it goes,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Partial articulation,” said the first captain. He straightened up. “May I see the
                plates again, please, doctor?” The third doctor handed him one of the plates. “No.
                The left leg, please.”</p>
            <p>“That is the left leg, doctor.”</p>
            <p>“You are right. I was looking from a different angle.” He returned the plate. The
                other plate he examined for some time. “You see, doctor?” he pointed to one of the
                foreign bodies which showed spherical and clear against the light. They examined the
                plate for some time.</p>
            <p>“Only one thing I can say,” the first captain with the beard said. “It is a question
                of time. Three months, six months probably.”</p>
            <p>“Certainly the synovial fluid must re-form.”</p>
            <p>“Certainly. It is a question of time. I could not conscientiously open a knee like
                that before the projectile was encysted.”</p>
            <p>“I agree with you, doctor.”</p>
            <p>“Six months for what?” I asked.</p>

            <pb n="104"/>

            <p>“Six months for the projectile to encyst before the knee can be opened safely.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe it,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Do you want to keep your knee, young man ?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said.</p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“I want it cut off,” I said, “so I can wear a hook on it.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean ? A hook ?”</p>
            <p>“He is joking,” said the house doctor. He patted my shoulder very delicately. “He
                wants to keep his knee. This is a very brave young man. He has been proposed for the
                silver medal of valor.”</p>
            <p>“All my felicitations,” said the first captain. He shook my hand. “I can only say
                that to be on the safe side you should wait at least six months before opening such
                a knee. You are welcome of course to another opinion.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you very much,” I said. “I value your opinion.”</p>
            <p>The first captain looked at his watch.</p>
            <p>“We must go,” he said. “All my best wishes.”</p>
            <p>“All my best wishes and many thanks,” I said. I shook hands with the third doctor,
                “Capitano Varini--Tenente Enry,” and they all three went out of the room.</p>
            <p>“Miss Gage,” I called. She came in. “Please ask the house doctor to come back a
                minute.”</p>
            <p>He came in holding his cap and stood by the bed. “Did you wish to see me?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. I can’t wait six months to be operated on. My God, doctor, did you ever stay in
                bed six months?”</p>
            <p>“You won’t be in bed all the time. You must first have the wounds exposed to the sun.
                Then afterward you can be on crutches.”</p>

            <pb n="105"/>

            <p>“For six months and then have an operation?”</p>
            <p>“That is the safe way. The foreign bodies must be allowed to encyst and the synovial
                fluid will re-form. Then it will be safe to open up the knee.”</p>
            <p>“Do you really think yourself I will have to wait that long?”</p>
            <p>“That is the safe way.”</p>
            <p>“Who is that first captain?”</p>
            <p>“He is a very excellent surgeon of Milan.”</p>
            <p>“He’s a first captain, isn’t he?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, but he is an excellent surgeon.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t want my leg fooled with by a first captain. If he was any good he would be
                made a major. I know what a first captain is, doctor.”</p>
            <p>“He is an excellent surgeon and I would rather have his judgment than any surgeon I
                know.”</p>
            <p>“Could another surgeon see it ?”</p>
            <p>“Certainly if you wish. But I would take Dr. Varella’s opinion myself.”</p>
            <p>“Could you ask another surgeon to come and see it?”</p>
            <p>“I will ask Valentini to come.”</p>
            <p>“Who is he?”</p>
            <p>“He is a surgeon of the Ospedale Maggiore.”</p>
            <p>“Good. I appreciate it very much. You understand, doctor, I couldn’t stay in bed six
                months.”</p>
            <p>“You would not be in bed. You would first take a sun cure. Then you could have light
                exercise. Then when it was encysted we would operate.”</p>
            <p>“But I can’t wait six months.”</p>
            <p>The doctor spread his delicate fingers on the cap he held and smiled. “You are in
                such a hurry to get back to the front?”</p>
            <p>“Why not?”</p>


            <pb n="106"/>

            <p>“It is very beautiful,” he said. “You are a noble young man.” He stooped over and
                kissed me very delicately on the forehead. “I will send for Valentini. Do not worry
                and excite yourself. Be a good boy.”</p>
            <p>“Will you have a drink?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“No thank you. I never drink alcohol.”</p>
            <p>“Just have one.” I rang for the porter to bring glasses.</p>
            <p>“No. No thank you. They are waiting for me.” “Good-by,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Good-by.”</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>Two hours later Dr. Valentini came into the room. He was in a great hurry and the
                points of his mustache stood straight up. He was a major, his face was tanned and he
                laughed all the time.</p>
            <p>“How did you do it, this rotten thing?” he asked. “Let me see the plates. Yes. Yes.
                That’s it. You look healthy as a goat. Who’s the pretty girl ? Is she your girl? I
                thought so. Isn’t this a bloody war? How does that feel? You are a fine boy. I’ll
                make you better than new. Does that hurt? You bet it hurts. How they love to hurt
                you, these doctors. What have they done for you so far? Can’t that girl talk
                Italian? She should learn. What a lovely girl. I could teach her. I will be a
                patient here myself. No, but I will do all your maternity work free. Does she
                understand that? She will make you a fine boy. A fine blonde like she is. That’s
                fine. That’s all right. What a lovely girl. Ask her if she eats supper with me. No I
                won’t take her away from you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss. That’s all.”</p>
            <p>That’s all I want to know.” He patted me on the shoulder. “Leave the dressings
                off.”</p>

            <pb n="107"/>

            <p>“Will you have a drink, Dr. Valentini?”</p>
            <p>“A drink? Certainly. I will have ten drinks. Where are they?”</p>
            <p>“In the armoire. Miss Barkley will get the bottle.”</p>
            <p>“Cheery oh. Cheery oh to you, Miss. What a lovely girl. I will bring you better
                cognac than that.” He wiped his mustache.</p>
            <p>“When do you think it can be operated on?”</p>
            <p>“To-morrow morning. Not before. Your stomach must be emptied. You must be washed out.
                I will see the old lady downstairs and leave instructions. Good-by. I see you
                to-morrow. I’ll bring you better cognac than that. You are very comfortable here.
                Good-by. Until to-morrow. Get a good sleep. I’ll see you early.” He waved from the
                doorway, his mustaches went straight up, his brown face was smiling. There was a
                star in a box on his sleeve because he was a major.</p>

            <p>That night a bat flew into the room through the open door that led onto the balcony
                and through which we watched the night over the roofs of the town. It was dark in
                our room except for the small light of the night over the town and the bat was not
                frightened but hunted in the room as though he had been outside. We lay and watched
                him and I do not think he saw us because we lay so still. After he went out we saw a
                searchlight come on and watched the beam move across the sky and then go off and it
                was dark again. A breeze came in the night and we heard the men of the anti-aircraft
                gun on the next roof talking. It was cool and they were putting on their capes. I
                worried in the night about some one coming up but Catherine said they were all
                asleep. Once in the night we went to sleep and when I woke she was not there but I
                heard her coming along the hall and the door opened and she came back to the bed and
                said it was all right she had been downstairs and they were all asleep. She had been
                outside Miss Van Campen’s door and heard her breathing in her sleep. She brought
                crackers and we ate them and drank some vermouth. We were very hungry but she said
                that would all have to be gotten out of me in the morning. I went to sleep again in
                the morning when it was light and when I was awake I found she was gone again. She
                came in looking fresh and lovely and sat on the bed and the sun rose while I had the
                thermometer in my mouth and we smelled the dew on the roofs and then the coffee of
                the men at the gun on the next roof.</p>

            <pb n="109"/>

            <p>“I wish we could go for a walk,” Catherine said. “I’d wheel you if we had a
                chair.”</p>
            <p>“How would I get into the chair?”</p>
            <p>“We’d do it.”</p>
            <p>“We could go out to the park and have breakfast outdoors.” I looked out the open
                doorway.</p>
            <p>“What we’ll really do,” she said, “is get you ready for your friend Dr.
                Valentini.”</p>
            <p>“I thought he was grand.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t like him as much as you did. But I imagine he’s very good.”</p>
            <p>“Come back to bed, Catherine. Please,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I can’t. Didn’t we have a lovely night?”</p>
            <p>“And can you be on night duty to-night?”</p>
            <p>“I probably will. But you won’t want me.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I will.”</p>
            <p>“No, you won’t. You’ve never been operated on. You don’t know how you’ll be.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll be all right.”</p>
            <p>“You’ll be sick and I won’t be anything to you.”</p>
            <p>“Come back then now.”</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. “I have to do the chart, darling, and fix you up.”</p>
            <p>“You don’t really love me or you’d come back again.”</p>
            <p>“You’re such a silly boy.” She kissed me. “That’s all right for the chart. Your
                temperature’s always normal. You’ve such a lovely temperature.”</p>
            <p>“You’ve got a lovely everything.”</p>
            <p>“Oh no. You have the lovely temperature. I’m awfully proud of your temperature.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe all our children will have fine temperatures.”</p>
            <p>“Our children will probably have beastly temperatures.”</p>

            <pb n="110"/>

            <p>“What do you have to do to get me ready for Valentini ?”</p>
            <p>“Not much. But quite unpleasant”</p>
            <p>“I wish you didn’t have to do it.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t. I don’t want any one else to touch you. I’m silly. I get furious if they
                touch you.”</p>
            <p>“Even Ferguson?”</p>
            <p>“Especially Ferguson and Gage and the other, what’s her name?”</p>
            <p>“Walker?”</p>
            <p>“That’s it. They’ve too many nurses here now. There must be some more patients or
                they’ll send us away. They have four nurses now.”</p>
            <p>“Perhaps there’ll be some. They need that many nurses. It’s quite a big
                hospital.”</p>
            <p>“I hope some will come. What would I do if they sent me away? They will unless there
                are more patients.”</p>
            <p>“I’d go too.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t be silly. You can’t go yet. But get well quickly, darling, and we will go
                somewhere.”</p>
            <p>“And then what?”</p>
            <p>“Maybe the war will be over. It can’t always go on.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll get well,” I said. “Valentini will fix me.”</p>
            <p>“He should with those mustaches. And, darling, when you’re going under the ether just
                think about something else--not us. Because people get very blabby under an
                anaesthetic.”</p>
            <p>“What should I think about?”</p>
            <p>“Anything. Anything but us. Think about your people. Or even any other girl.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>

            <pb n="111"/>

            <p>“Say your prayers then. That ought to create a splendid impression.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe I won’t talk.”</p>
            <p>“That’s true. Often people don’t talk.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t talk.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t brag, darling. Please don’t brag. You’re so sweet and you don’t have to
                brag.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t talk a word.”</p>
            <p>“Now you’re bragging, darling. You know you don’t need to brag. Just start your
                prayers or poetry or something when they tell you to breathe deeply. You’ll be
                lovely that way and I’ll be so proud of you. I’m very proud of you anyway. You have
                such a lovely temperature and you sleep like a little boy with your arm around the
                pillow and think it’s me. Or is it some other girl? Some fine Italian girl?”</p>
            <p>“It’s you.”</p>
            <p>“Of course it’s me. Oh I do love you and Valentini will make you a fine leg. I’m glad
                I don’t have to watch it.”</p>
            <p>“And you’ll be on night duty to-night.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. But you won’t care.”</p>
            <p>“You wait and see.”</p>
            <p>“There, darling. Now you’re all clean inside and out. Tell me. How many people have
                you ever loved?”</p>
            <p>“Nobody.”</p>
            <p>“Not me even?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, you.”</p>
            <p>“How many others really?”</p>
            <p>“None.”</p>
            <p>“How many have you--how do you say it?--stayed with ?”</p>
            <p>“None.”</p>

            <pb n="112"/>

            <p>“You’re lying to me.”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“It’s all right. Keep right on lying to me. That’s what I want you to do. Were they
                pretty?”</p>
            <p>“I never stayed with any one.”</p>
            <p>“That’s right. Were they very attractive?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know anything about it.”</p>
            <p>“You’re just mine. That’s true and you’ve never belonged to any one else. But I don’t
                care if you have. I’m not afraid of them. But don’t tell me about them. When a man
                stays with a girl when does she say how much it costs?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
            <p>“Of course not. Does she say she loves him? Tell me that. I want to know that.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. If he wants her to.”</p>
            <p>“Does he say he loves her? Tell me please. It’s important.”</p>
            <p>“He does if he wants to.”</p>
            <p>“But you never did ? Really ?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Not really. Tell me the truth?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I lied.</p>
            <p>“You wouldn’t,” she said. “I knew you wouldn’t. Oh, I love you, darling.”</p>
            <p>Outside the sun was up over the roofs and I could see the points of the cathedral
                with the sunlight on them. I was clean inside and outside and waiting for the
                doctor.</p>
            <p>“And that’s it?” Catherine said. “She says just what he wants her to?”</p>
            <p>“Not always.”</p>
            <p>“But I will. I’ll say just what you wish and I’ll do what you wish and then you will
                never want any other <pb n="113"/> girls, will you ?” She looked at me very happily.
                “I’ll do what you want and say what you want and then I’ll be a great success, won’t
                I?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“What would you like me to do now that you’re all ready ?”</p>
            <p>“Come to the bed again.”</p>
            <p>“All right I’ll come.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, darling, darling, darling,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You see,” she said. “I do anything you want.”</p>
            <p>“You’re so lovely.”</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid I’m not very good at it yet.”</p>
            <p>“You’re lovely.”</p>
            <p>“I want what you want. There isn’t any me any more. Just what you want.”</p>
            <p>“You sweet.”</p>
            <p>“I’m good. Aren’t I good? You don’t want any other girls, do you?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>

            <p>When I was awake after the operation I had not been away. You do not go away. They
                only choke you. It is not like dying it is just a chemical choking so you do not
                feel, and afterward you might as well have been drunk except that when you throw up
                nothing comes but bile and you do not feel better afterward. I saw sandbags at the
                end of the bed. They were on pipes that came out of the cast. After a while I saw
                Miss Gage and she said, “How is it now?”</p>
            <p>“Better,” I said.</p>
            <p>“He did a wonderful job on your knee.”</p>
            <p>“How long did it take?”</p>
            <p>“Two hours and a half.”</p>
            <p>“Did I say anything silly?”</p>
            <p>“Not a thing. Don’t talk. Just be quiet.”</p>
            <p>I was sick and Catherine was right. It did not make any difference who was on night
                duty.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
            <p>There were three other patients in the hospital now, a thin boy in the Red Cross from
                Georgia with malaria, a nice boy, also thin, from New York, with malaria and
                jaundice, and a fine boy who had tried to unscrew the fuse-cap from a combination
                shrapnel and high explosive shell for a souvenir. This was a shrapnel shell used by
                the Austrians in the mountains with a nose-cap which went on after the burst and
                exploded on contact.</p>
            <p>Catherine Barkley was greatly liked by the nurses because she would do night duty
                indefinitely. She had quite a little work with the malaria people, the boy who <pb
                    n="115"/> had unscrewed the nose-cap was a friend of ours and never rang at
                night, unless it was necessary but between the times of working we were together. I
                loved her very much and she loved me. I slept in the daytime and we wrote notes
                during the day when we were awake and sent them by Ferguson. Ferguson was a fine
                girl. I never learned anything about her except that she had a brother in the
                Fifty-Second Division and a brother in Mesopotamia and she was very good to
                Catherine Barkley.</p>
            <p>“Will you come to our wedding, Fergy?” I said to her once.</p>
            <p>“You’ll never get married.”</p>
            <p>“We will.”</p>
            <p>“No you won’t.”</p>
            <p>“Why not?”</p>
            <p>“You’ll fight before you’ll marry.”</p>
            <p>“We never fight.”</p>
            <p>“You’ve time yet.”</p>
            <p>“We don’t fight.”</p>
            <p>“You’ll die then. Fight or die. That’s what people do. They don’t marry.”</p>
            <p>I reached for her hand. “Don’t take hold of me,” she said. “I’m not crying. Maybe
                you’ll be all right you two. But watch out you don’t get her in trouble. You get her
                in trouble and I’ll kill you.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t get her in trouble.”</p>
            <p>“Well watch out then. I hope you’ll be all right. You have a good time.”</p>
            <p>“We have a fine time.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t fight then and don’t get her into trouble.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t.”</p>
            <p>“Mind you watch out. I don’t want her with any of these war babies.”</p>

            <pb n="116"/>

            <p>“You’re a fine girl, Fergy.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not. Don’t try to flatter me. How does your leg feel?”</p>
            <p>“Fine.”</p>
            <p>“How is your head?” She touched the top of it with her fingers. It was sensitive like
                a foot that had gone to sleep. “It’s never bothered me.”</p>
            <p>“A bump like that could make you crazy. It never bothers you?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a lucky young man. Have you the letter done? I’m going down.”</p>
            <p>“It’s here,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You ought to ask her not to do night duty for a while. She’s getting very
                tired.”</p>
            <p>“All right. I will.”</p>
            <p>“I want to do it but she won’t let me. The others are glad to let her have it. You
                might give her just a little rest.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“Miss Van Campen spoke about you sleeping all the forenoons.”</p>
            <p>“She would.”</p>
            <p>“It would be better if you let her stay off nights a little while.”</p>
            <p>“I want her to.”</p>
            <p>“You do not. But if you would make her I’d respect you for it.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll make her.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe it.” She took the note and went out. I rang the bell and in a little
                while Miss Gage came in.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
            <p>“I just wanted to talk to you. Don’t you think Miss Barkley ought to go off night
                duty for a while? She <pb n="117"/> looks awfully tired. Why does she stay on so
                long?” Miss Gage looked at me.</p>
            <p>“I’m a friend of yours,” she said. “You don’t have to talk to me like that.”</p>
            <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t be silly. Was that all you wanted?”</p>
            <p>“Do you want a vermouth ?”</p>
            <p>“All right. Then I have to go.” She got out the bottle from the armoire and brought a
                glass.</p>
            <p>“You take the glass,” I said. “I’ll drink out of the bottle.”</p>
            <p>“Here’s to you,” said Miss Gage.</p>
            <p>“What did Van Campen say about me sleeping late in the mornings?”</p>
            <p>“She just jawed about it. She calls you our privileged patient.”</p>
            <p>“To hell with her.”</p>
            <p>“She isn’t mean,” Miss Gage said. “She’s just old and cranky. She never liked
                you.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Well, I do. And I’m your friend. Don’t forget that.”</p>
            <p>“You’re awfully damned nice.”</p>
            <p>“No. I know who you think is nice. But I’m your friend. How does your leg feel?”</p>
            <p>“Fine.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll bring some cold mineral water to pour over it. It must itch under the cast.
                It’s hot outside.”</p>
            <p>“You’re awful nice.”</p>
            <p>“Does it itch much?”</p>
            <p>“No. It’s fine.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll fix those sandbags better.” She leaned over. “I’m your friend.”</p>

            <pb n="118"/>


            <p>“I know you are.”</p>
            <p>“No you don’t. But you will some day.”</p>
            <p>Catherine Barkley took three nights off night duty and then she came back on again.
                It was as though we met again after each of us had been away on a long journey.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>

            <p>We had a lovely time that summer. When I could go out we rode in a carriage in the
                park. I remember the carriage, the horse going slowly, and up ahead the back of the
                driver with his varnished high hat, and Catherine Barkley sitting beside me. If we
                let our hands touch, just the side of my hand touching hers, we were excited.
                Afterward when I could get around on crutches we went to dinner at Biffi’s or the
                Gran Italia and sat at the tables outside on the floor of the galleria. The waiters
                came in and out and there were people going by and candles with shades on the
                tablecloths and after we decided that we liked the Gran Italia best, George, the
                head-waiter, saved us a table. He was a fine waiter and we let him order the meal
                while we looked at the people, and the great galleria in the dusk, and each other.
                We drank dry white capri iced in a bucket; although we tried many of the other
                wines, fresa, barbera and the sweet white wines. They had no wine waiter because of
                the war and George would smile ashamedly when I asked about wines like fresa.</p>
            <p>“If you imagine a country that makes a wine because it tastes like strawberries,” he
                said.</p>
            <p>“Why shouldn’t it?” Catherine asked. “It sounds splendid.”</p>
            <p>“You try it, lady,” said George, “if you want to. But let me bring a little bottle of
                margaux for the Tenente.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll try it too, George.”</p>

            <pb n="120"/>

            <p>“Sir, I can’t recommend you to. It doesn’t even taste like strawberries.”</p>
            <p>“It might,” said Catherine. “It would be wonderful if it did.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll bring it,” said George, “and when the Lady is satisfied I’ll take it away.”</p>
            <p>It was not much of a wine. As he said, it did not even taste like strawberries. We
                went back to capri. One evening I was short of money and George loaned me a hundred
                lire. “That’s all right, Tenente,” he said. “I know how it is. I know how a man gets
                short. If you or the lady need money I’ve always got money.”</p>
            <p>After dinner we walked through the galleria, past the other restaurants and the shops
                with their steel shutters down, and stopped at the little place where they sold
                sandwiches; ham and lettuce sandwiches and anchovy sandwiches made of very tiny
                brown glazed rolls and only about as long as your finger. They were to eat in the
                night when we were hungry. Then we got into an open carriage outside the galleria in
                front of the cathedral and rode to the hospital. At the door of the hospital the
                porter came out to help with the crutches. I paid the driver, and then we rode
                upstairs in the elevator. Catherine got off at the lower floor where the nurses
                lived and I went on up and went down the hall on crutches to my room; sometimes I
                undressed and got into bed and sometimes I sat out on the balcony with my leg up on
                another chair and watched the swallows over the roofs and waited for Catherine. When
                she came upstairs it was as though she had been away on a long trip and I went along
                the hall with her on the crutches and carried the basins and waited outside the
                doors, or went in with her; it depending on whether they were friends of ours or
                not, and when <pb n="121"/> she had done all there was to be done we sat out on the
                balcony outside my room. Afterward I went to bed and when they were all asleep and
                she was sure they would not call she came in. I loved to take her hair down and she
                sat on the bed and kept very still, except suddenly she would dip down to kiss me
                while I was doing it, and I would take out the pins and lay them on the sheet and it
                would be loose and I would watch her while she kept very still and then take out the
                last two pins and it would all come down and she would drop her head and we would
                both be inside of it, and it was the feeling of inside a tent or behind a falls.</p>
            <p>She had wonderfully beautiful hair and I would lie sometimes and watch her twisting
                it up in the light that came in the open door and it shone even in the night as
                water shines sometimes just before it is really daylight. She had a lovely face and
                body and lovely smooth skin too. We would be lying together and I would touch her
                cheeks and her forehead and under her eyes and her chin and throat with the tips of
                my fingers and say, “Smooth as piano keys,” and she would stroke my chin with her
                finger and say, “Smooth as emery paper and very hard on piano keys.”</p>
            <p>“Is it rough?”</p>
            <p>“No, darling. I was just making fun of you.”</p>
            <p>It was lovely in the nights and if we could only touch each other we were happy.
                Besides all the big times we had many small ways of making love and we tried putting
                thoughts in the other one’s head while we were in different rooms. It seemed to work
                sometimes but that was probably because we were thinking the same thing anyway.</p>
            <p>We said to each other that we were married the first day she had come to the hospital
                and we counted <pb n="117"/> months from our wedding day. I wanted to be really
                married but Catherine said that if we were they would send her away and if we merely
                started on the formalities they would watch her and would break us up. We would have
                to be married under Italian law and the formalities were terrific. I wanted us to be
                married really because I worried about having a child if I thought about it, but we
                pretended to ourselves we were married and did not worry much and I suppose I
                enjoyed not being married, really. I know one night we talked about it and Catherine
                said, “But, darling, they’d send me away.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe they wouldn’t.”</p>
            <p>“They would. They’d send me home and then we would be apart until after the war.”</p>
            <p>“I’d come on leave.”</p>
            <p>“You couldn’t get to Scotland and back on a leave. Besides, I won’t leave you. What
                good would it do to marry now? We’re really married. I couldn’t be any more
                married.”</p>
            <p>“I only wanted to for you.”</p>
            <p>“There isn’t any me. I’m you. Don’t make up a separate me.”</p>
            <p>“I thought girls always wanted to be married.”</p>
            <p>“They do. But, darling, I am married. I’m married to you. Don’t I make you a good
                wife?”</p>
            <p>“You’re a lovely wife.”</p>
            <p>“You see, darling, I had one experience of waiting to be married.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t want to hear about it.”</p>
            <p>“You know I don’t love any one but you. You shouldn’t mind because some one else
                loved me.”</p>
            <p>“I do.”</p>

            <pb n="123"/>

            <p>“You shouldn’t be jealous of some one who’s dead when you have everything.”</p>
            <p>“No, but I don’t want to hear about it.”</p>
            <p>“Poor darling. And I know you’ve been with all kinds of girls and it doesn’t matter
                to me.”</p>
            <p>“Couldn’t we be married privately some way? Then if anything happened to me or if you
                had a child.”</p>
            <p>“There’s no way to be married except by church or state. We are married privately.
                You see, darling, it would mean everything to me if I had any religion. But I
                haven’t any religion.”</p>
            <p>“You gave me the Saint Anthony.”</p>
            <p>“That was for luck. Some one gave it to me.</p>
            <p>“Then nothing worries you?”</p>
            <p>“Only being sent away from you. You’re my religion. You’re all I've got.”</p>
            <p>“All right. But I’ll marry you the day you say.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t talk as though you had to make an honest woman of me, darling. I’m a very
                honest woman. You can’t be ashamed of something if you’re only happy and proud of
                it. Aren’t you happy?”</p>
            <p>“But you won’t ever leave me for some one else.”</p>
            <p>“No, darling. I won’t ever leave you for some one else. I suppose all sorts of
                dreadful things will happen to us. But you don’t have to worry about that.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t. But I love you so much and you did love some one else before.”</p>
            <p>“And what happened to him?”</p>
            <p>“He died.”</p>
            <p>“Yes and if he hadn’t I wouldn’t have met you. I’m not unfaithful, darling. I’ve
                plenty of faults but I’m very faithful. You’ll be sick of me I’ll be so
                faithful.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll have to go back to the front pretty soon.”</p>
            <p>“We won’t think about that until you go. You see <pb n="124"/> I’m happy, darling,
                and we have a lovely time. I haven’t been happy for a long time and when I met you
                perhaps I was nearly crazy. Perhaps I was crazy. But now we’re happy and we love
                each other. Do let’s please just be happy. You are happy, aren’t you? Is there
                anything I do you don't like ? Can I do anything to please you? Would you like me to
                take down my hair? Do you want to play?”</p>
            <p>“Yes and come to bed.”</p>
            <p>“All right. I’ll go and see the patients first”</p>

            <p>The summer went that way. I do not remember much about the days, except that they
                were hot and that there were many victories in the papers. I was very healthy and my
                legs healed quickly so that it was not very long after I was first on crutches
                before I was through with them and walking with a cane. Then I started treatments at
                the Ospedale Maggiore for bending the knees, mechanical treatments, baking in a box
                of mirrors with violet rays, massage, and baths. I went over there afternoons and
                afterward stopped at the café and had a drink and read the papers. I did not roam
                around the town; but wanted to get home to the hospital from the cafe. All I wanted
                was to see Catherine. The rest of the time I was glad to kill. Mostly I slept in the
                mornings, and in the afternoons, sometimes, I went to the races, and late to the
                mechano-therapy treatments. Sometimes I stopped in at the Anglo-American Club and
                sat in a deep leather-cushioned chair in front of the window and read the magazines.
                They would not let us go out together when I was off crutches because it was
                unseemly for a nurse to be seen unchaperoned with a patient who did not look as
                though he needed attendance, so we were not together much in the afternoons.
                Although sometimes we could go out to dinner if Ferguson went along. Miss Van Campen
                had accepted the status that we were great friends because she got a great amount of
                work out of Catherine. She thought Catherine came from very good people and that
                prejudiced her in her favor finally. Miss Van Campen admired family
                <pb n="126"/> very much and came from an excellent family herself. The hospital was
                quite busy, too, and that kept her occupied. It was a hot summer and I knew many
                people in Milan but always was anxious to get back home to the hospital as soon as
                the afternoon was over. At the front they were advancing on the Carso, they had
                taken Kuk across from Plava and were taking the Bainsizza plateau. The West front
                did not sound so good. It looked as though the war were going on for a long time. We
                were in the war now but I thought it would take a year to get any great amount of
                troops over and train them for combat. Next year would be a bad year, or a good year
                maybe. The Italians were using up an awful amount of men. I did not see how it could
                go on. Even if they took all the Bainsizza and Monte San Gabriele there were plenty
                of mountains beyond for the Austrians. I had seen them. All the highest mountains
                were beyond. On the Carso they were going forward but there were marshes and swamps
                down by the sea. Napoleon would have whipped the Austrians on the plains. He never
                would have fought them in the mountains. He would have let them come down and
                whipped them around Verona. Still nobody was whipping any one on the Western front.
                Perhaps wars weren’t won any more. Maybe they went on forever. Maybe it was another
                Hundred Years’ War. I put the paper back on the rack and left the club. I went down
                the steps carefully and walked up the Via Manzoni. Outside the Gran Hotel I met old
                Meyers and his wife getting out of a carriage. They were coming back from the races.
                She was a big-busted woman in black satin. He was short and old, with a white
                mustache and walked flat-footed with a cane.</p>

            <pb n="127"/>

            <p>“How do you do? How do you do?” She shook hands. “Hello,” said Meyers.</p>
            <p>“How were the races ?”</p>
            <p>“Fine. They were just lovely. I had three winners.” “How did you do?” I asked
                Meyers.</p>
            <p>“All right. I had a winner.”</p>
            <p>“I never know how he does,” Mrs. Meyers said. “He never tells me.”</p>
            <p>“I do all right,” Meyers said. He was being cordial. “You ought to come out.” While
                he talked you had the impression that he was not looking at you or that he mistook
                you for some one else.</p>
            <p>“I will,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I’m coming up to the hospital to see you,” Mrs. Meyers said. “I have some things for
                my boys. You’re all my boys. You certainly are my dear boys.”</p>
            <p>“They’ll be glad to see you.”</p>
            <p>“Those dear boys. You too. You’re one of my boys.”</p>
            <p>“I have to get back,” I said.</p>
            <p>“You give my love to all those dear boys. I’ve got lots of things to bring. I’ve some
                fine Marsala and cakes.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by,” I said. “They’ll be awfully glad to see you.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by,” said Meyers. “You come around to the galleria. You know where my table is.
                We’re all there every afternoon.” I went on up the street. I wanted to buy something
                at the Cova to take to Catherine. Inside, at the Cova, I bought a box of chocolate
                and while the girl wrapped it up I walked over to the bar. There were a couple of
                British and some aviators. I had a martini alone, paid for it, picked up the box of
                chocolate at the outside counter and walked on home toward <pb n="128"/> the
                hospital. Outside the little bar up the street from the Scala there were some people
                I knew, a vice-consul, two fellows who studied singing, and Ettore Moretti, an
                Italian from San Francisco who was in the Italian army. I had a drink with them. One
                of the singers was named Ralph Simmons, and he was singing under the name of Enrico
                DelCredo. I never knew how well he could sing but he was always on the point of
                something very big happening. He was fat and looked shopworn around the nose and
                mouth as though he had hayfever. He had come back from singing in Piacenza. He had
                sung Tosca and it had been wonderful.</p>
            <p>“Of course you’ve never heard me sing,” he said.</p>
            <p>“When will you sing here?”</p>
            <p>“I’ll be at the Scala in the fall.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll bet they throw the benches at you,” Ettore said. “Did you hear how they threw
                the benches at him in Modena ?”</p>
            <p>“It’s a damned lie.”</p>
            <p>“They threw the benches at him,” Ettore said. “I was there. I threw six benches
                myself.”</p>
            <p>“You’re just a wop from Frisco.”</p>
            <p>“He can’t pronounce Italian,” Ettore said. “Everywhere he goes they throw the benches
                at him.”</p>
            <p>“Piacenza’s the toughest house to sing in the north of Italy,” the other tenor said.
                “Believe me that’s a tough little house to sing.” This tenor’s name was Edgar
                Saunders, and he sang under the name of Edouardo Giovanni.</p>
            <p>“I’d like to be there to see them throw the benches at you,” Ettore said. “You can’t
                sing Italian.”</p>
            <p>“He’s a nut,” said Edgar Saunders. “All he knows how to say is throw benches.”</p>

            <pb n="129"/>

            <p>“That’s all they know how to do when you two sing,” Ettore said. “Then when you go to
                America you’ll tell about your triumphs at the Scala. They wouldn’t let you get by
                the first note at the Scala.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll sing at the Scala,” Simmons said. “I’m going to sing Tosca in October.”</p>
            <p>“We’ll go, won’t we, Mac?” Ettore said to the vice-consul. “They’ll need somebody to
                protect them.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe the American army will be there to protect them,” the vice-consul said. “Do
                you want another drink, Simmons? You want a drink, Saunders?”</p>
            <p>“All right,” said Saunders.</p>
            <p>“I hear you’re going to get the silver medal,” Ettore said to me. “What kind of
                citation you going to get?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. I don’t know I’m going to get it.”</p>
            <p>“You’re going to get it. Oh boy, the girls at the Cova will think you’re fine then.
                They’ll all think you killed two hundred Austrians or captured a whole trench by
                yourself. Believe me, I got to work for my decorations.”</p>
            <p>“How many have you got, Ettore?” asked the vice-consul.</p>
            <p>“He’s got everything,” Simmons said. “He’s the boy they’re running the war for.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve got the bronze twice and three silver medals,” said Ettore. “But the papers on
                only one have come through.”</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter with the others?” asked Simmons.</p>
            <p>“The action wasn’t successful,” said Ettore. “When the action isn’t successful they
                hold up all the medals.”</p>
            <p>“How many times have you been wounded, Ettore ?”</p>
            <p>“Three times bad. I got three wound stripes. See ?”</p>

            <pb n="130"/>

            <p>He pulled his sleeve around. The stripes were parallel silver lines on a black
                background sewed to the cloth of the sleeve about eight inches below the
                shoulder.</p>
            <p>“You got one too,” Ettore said to me. “Believe me they’re fine to have. I’d rather
                have them than medals. Believe me, boy, when you get three you’ve got something. You
                only get one for a wound that puts you three months in the hospital.”</p>
            <p>“Where were you wounded, Ettore?” asked the vice-consul.</p>
            <p>Ettore pulled up his sleeve. “Here,” he showed the deep smooth red scar. “Here on my
                leg. I can’t show you that because I got puttees on; and in the foot. There’s dead
                bone in my foot that stinks right now. Every morning I take new little pieces out
                and it stinks all the time.”</p>
            <p>“What hit you?” asked Simmons.</p>
            <p>“A hand-grenade. One of those potato mashers. It just blew the whole side of my foot
                off. You know those potato mashers?” He turned to me.</p>
            <p>“Sure.”</p>
            <p>“I saw the son of a bitch throw it,” Ettore said. “It knocked me down and I thought I
                was dead all right but those damn potato mashers haven’t got anything in them. I
                shot the son of a bitch with my rifle. I always carry a rifle so they can’t tell I’m
                an officer.”</p>
            <p>“How did he look?” asked Simmons.</p>
            <p>“That was the only one he had,” Ettore said. “I don’t know why he threw it. I guess
                he always wanted to throw one. He never saw any real fighting probably. I shot the
                son of a bitch all right.”</p>
            <p>“How did he look when you shot him?” Simmons asked.</p>
            <p>“Hell, how should I know,” said Ettore. “I shot him <pb n="131"/> in the belly. I was
                afraid I’d miss him if I shot him in the head.”</p>
            <p>“How long have you been an officer, Ettore?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“Two years. I'm going to be a captain. How long have you been a lieutenant?”</p>
            <p>“Going on three years.”</p>
            <p>“You can’t be a captain because you don’t know the Italian language well enough,”
                Ettore said. “You can talk but you can’t read and write well enough. You got to have
                an education to be a captain. Why don’t you go in the American army?”</p>
            <p>“Maybe I will.”</p>
            <p>“I wish to God I could. Oh, boy, how much does a captain get, Mac?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know exactly. Around two hundred and fifty dollars, I think.”</p>
            <p>“Jesus Christ what I could do with two hundred and fifty dollars. You better get in
                the American army quick, Fred. See if you can’t get me in.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“I can command a company in Italian. I could learn it in English easy.”</p>
            <p>“You’d be a general,” said Simmons.</p>
            <p>“No, I don’t know enough to be a general. A general’s got to know a hell of a lot.
                You guys think there ain’t anything to war. You ain’t got brains enough to be a
                second-class corporal.”</p>
            <p>“Thank God I don’t have to be,” Simmons said.</p>
            <p>“Maybe you will if they round up all you slackers. Oh, boy, I’d like to have you two
                in my platoon. Mac too. I’d make you my orderly, Mac.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a great boy, Ettore,” Mac said. “But I’m afraid you’re a militarist.”</p>

            <pb n="132"/>

            <p>“I’ll be a colonel before the war’s over,” Ettore said.</p>
            <p>“If they don’t kill you.”</p>
            <p>“They won’t kill me.” He touched the stars at his collar with his thumb and
                forefinger. “See me do that? We always touch our stars if anybody mentions getting
                killed.”</p>
            <p>“Let’s go, Sim,” said Saunders standing up.</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“So long,” I said. “I have to go too.” It was a quarter to six by the clock inside
                the bar. “Ciaou, Ettore.”</p>
            <p>“Ciaou, Fred,” said Ettore. “That’s pretty fine you’re going to get the silver
                medal.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know I’ll get it.”</p>
            <p>“You’ll get it all right, Fred. I heard you were going to get it all right.”</p>
            <p>“Well, so long,” I said. “Keep out of trouble, Ettore.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t worry about me. I don’t drink and I don’t run around. I’m no boozer and
                whorehound. I know what’s good for me.”</p>
            <p>“So long,” I said. “I’m glad you’re going to be promoted captain.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t have to wait to be promoted. I’m going to be a captain for merit of war. You
                know. Three stars with the crossed swords and crown above. That’s me.”</p>
            <p>“Good luck.”</p>
            <p>“Good luck. When you going back to the front?”</p>
            <p>“Pretty soon.”</p>
            <p>“Well, I’ll see you around.”</p>
            <p>“So long.”</p>
            <p>“So long. Don’t take any bad nickels.”</p>
            <p>I walked on down a back street that led to a crosscut to the hospital. Ettore was
                twenty-three. He had <pb n="133"/> been brought up by an uncle in San Francisco and
                was visiting his father and mother in Torino when war was declared. He had a sister,
                who had been sent to America with him at the same time to live with the uncle, who
                would graduate from normal school this year. He was a legitimate hero who bored
                every one he met. Catherine could not stand him.</p>
            <p>“We have heroes too,” she said. “But usually, darling, they’re much quieter.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t mind him.”</p>
            <p>“I wouldn’t mind him if he wasn’t so conceited and didn’t bore me, and bore me, and
                bore me.”</p>
            <p>“He bores me.”</p>
            <p>“You’re sweet to say so, darling. But you don’t need to. You can picture him at the
                front and you know he’s useful but he’s so much the type of boy I don’t care
                for.”</p>
            <p>“I know.”</p>
            <p>“You’re awfully sweet to know, and I try and like him but he’s a dreadful, dreadful
                boy really.”</p>
            <p>“He said this afternoon he was going to be a captain.”</p>
            <p>“I’m glad,” said Catherine. “That should please him.”</p>
            <p>“Wouldn’t you like me to have some more exalted rank?”</p>
            <p>“No, darling. I only want you to have enough rank so that we’re admitted to the
                better restaurants.”</p>
            <p>“That’s just the rank I have.”</p>
            <p>“You have a splendid rank. I don’t want you to have any more rank. It might go to
                your head. Oh, darling, I’m awfully glad you’re not conceited. I’d have married you
                even if you were conceited but it’s very restful to have a husband who’s not
                conceited.”</p>

            <pb n="134"/>

            <p>We were talking softly out on the balcony. The moon was supposed to rise but there
                was a mist over the town and it did not come up and in a little while it started to
                drizzle and we came in. Outside the mist turned to rain and in a little while it was
                raining hard and we heard it drumming on the roof. I got up and stood at the door to
                see if it was raining in but it wasn’t, so I left the door open.</p>
            <p>“Who else did you see?” Catherine asked.</p>
            <p>“Mr. and Mrs. Meyers.”</p>
            <p>“They’re a strange lot.”</p>
            <p>“He’s supposed to have been in the penitentiary at home. They let him out to
                die.”</p>
            <p>“And he lived happily in Milan forever after.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know how happily.”</p>
            <p>“Happily enough after jail I should think.”</p>
            <p>“She’s bringing some things here.”</p>
            <p>“She brings splendid things. Were you her dear boy?”</p>
            <p>“One of them.”</p>
            <p>“You are all her dear boys,” Catherine said. “She prefers the dear boys. Listen to it
                rain.”</p>
            <p>“It’s raining hard.”</p>
            <p>“And you’ll always love me, won’t you ?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“And the rain won’t make any difference?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“That’s good. Because I’m afraid of the rain.”</p>
            <p>“Why?” I was sleepy. Outside the rain was falling steadily.</p>
            <p>“I don’t know, darling. I’ve always been afraid of the rain.”</p>
            <p>“I like it.”</p>

            <pb n="135"/>

            <p>“I like to walk in it. But it’s very hard on loving.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll love you always.”</p>
            <p>“I'll love you in the rain and in the snow and in the hail and--what else is
                there?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. I guess I’m sleepy.”</p>
            <p>“Go to sleep, darling, and I’ll love you no matter how it is.”</p>
            <p>“You’re not really afraid of the rain are you?”</p>
            <p>“Not when I’m with you.”</p>
            <p>“Why are you afraid of it?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
            <p>“Tell me.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t make me.”</p>
            <p>“Tell me.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Tell me.”</p>
            <p>“All right. I’m afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“And sometimes I see you dead in it.”</p>
            <p>“That’s more likely.”</p>
            <p>“No it’s not, darling. Because I can keep you safe. I know I can. But nobody can help
                themselves.”</p>
            <p>“Please stop it. I don’t want you to get Scotch and crazy to-night. We won’t be
                together much longer.”</p>
            <p>“No, but I am Scotch and crazy. But I’ll stop it. It’s all nonsense.”</p>
            <p>“Yes it’s all nonsense.”</p>
            <p>“It’s all nonsense. It’s only nonsense. I’m not afraid of the rain. I’m not afraid of
                the rain. Oh, oh, God, I wish I wasn’t.” She was crying. I comforted her and she
                stopped crying. But outside it kept on raining.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
            <p>One day in the afternoon we went to the races. Ferguson went too and Crowell Rodgers,
                the boy who had been wounded in the eyes by the explosion of the shell nose-cap. The
                girls dressed to go after lunch while Crowell arid I sat on the bed in his room and
                read the past performances of the horses and the predictions in the racing paper.
                Crowell’s head was bandaged and he did not care much about these races but read the
                racing paper constantly and kept track of all the horses for something to do. He
                said the horses were a terrible lot but they were all the horses we had. Old Meyers
                liked him and gave him tips. Meyers won on nearly every race but disliked to give
                tips because it brought down the prices. The racing was very crooked. Men who had
                been ruled off the turf everywhere else were racing in Italy. Meyers’ information
                was good but I hated to ask him because sometimes he did not answer, and always you
                could see it hurt him to tell you, but he felt obligated to tell us for some reason
                and he hated less to tell Crowell. Crowell’s eyes had been hurt, one was hurt badly,
                and Meyers had trouble with his eyes and so he liked Crowell. Meyers never told his
                wife what horses he was playing and she won or lost, mostly lost, and talked all the
                time.</p>
            <p>We four drove out to San Siro in an open carriage. It was a lovely day and we drove
                out through the park and out along the tramway and out of town where the road was
                dusty. There were villas with iron fences and big overgrown gardens and ditches with
                water flowing and green vegetable gardens with dust on the leaves. <pb n="137"/> We
                could look across the plain and see farmhouses and the rich green farms with their
                irrigation ditches and the mountains to the north. There were many carriages going
                into the race track and the men at the gate let us in without cards because we were
                in uniform. We left the carriage, bought programmes, and walked across the infield
                and then across the smooth thick turf of the course to the paddock. The grand stands
                were old and made of wood and the betting booths were under the stands and in a row
                out near the stables. There was a crowd of soldiers along the fence in the infield.
                The paddock was fairly well filled with people and they were walking the horses
                around in a ring under the trees behind the grand stand. We saw people we knew and
                got chairs for Ferguson and Catherine and watched the horses.</p>
            <p>They went around, one after the other, their heads down, the grooms leading them. One
                horse, a purplish black, Crowell swore was dyed that color. We watched him and it
                seemed possible. He had only come out just before the bell rang to saddle. We looked
                him up in the programme from the number on the groom’s arm and it was listed a black
                gelding named Japalac. The race was for horses that had never won a race worth one
                thousand lire or more. Catherine was sure his color had been changed. Ferguson said
                she could not tell. I thought he looked suspicious. We all agreed we ought to back
                him and pooled one hundred lire. The odds sheets showed he would pay thirty-five to
                one. Crowell went over and bought the tickets while we watched the jockeys ride
                around once more and then go out under the trees to the track and gallop slowly up
                to the turn where the start was to be.</p>
            <p>We went up in the grand-stand to watch the race. <pb n="138"/> They had no elastic
                barrier at San Siro then and the starter lined up all the horses, they looked very
                small way up the track, and then sent them off with a crack of his long whip. They
                came past us with the black horse well in front and on the turn he was running away
                from the others. I watched them on the far side with the glasses and saw the jockey
                fighting to hold him in but he could not hold him and when they came around the turn
                and into the stretch the black horse was fifteen lengths ahead of the others. He
                went way on up and around the turn after the finish.</p>
            <p>“Isn’t it wonderful,” Catherine said. “We’ll have over three thousand lire. He must
                be a splendid horse.”</p>
            <p>“I hope his color doesn’t run,” Crowell said, “before they pay off.”</p>
            <p>“He was really a lovely horse,” Catherine said. “I wonder if Mr. Meyers backed
                him.”</p>
            <p>“Did you have the winner ?” I called to Meyers. He nodded.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t,” Mrs. Meyers said. “Who did you children bet on?”</p>
            <p>“Japalac.”</p>
            <p>“Really? He’s thirty-five to one!”</p>
            <p>“We liked his color.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t. I thought he looked seedy. They told me not to back him.”</p>
            <p>“He won’t pay much,” Meyers said.</p>
            <p>“He’s marked thirty-five to one in the quotes,” I said.</p>
            <p>“He won’t pay much. At the last minute,” Meyers said, “they put a lot of money on
                him.”</p>
            <p>“Who?”</p>
            <p>“Kempton and the boys. You’ll see. He won’t pay two to one.”</p>

            <pb n="139"/>

            <p>“Then we won’t get three thousand lire,” Catherine said. “I don’t like this crooked
                racing!”</p>
            <p>“We’ll get two hundred lire.”</p>
            <p>“That’s nothing. That doesn’t do us any good. I thought we were going to get three
                thousand.”</p>
            <p>“It’s crooked and disgusting,” Ferguson said.</p>
            <p>“Of course,” said Catherine, “if it hadn’t been crooked we’d never have backed him at
                all. But I would have liked the three thousand lire.”</p>
            <p>“Let’s go down and get a drink and see what they pay,” Crowell said. We went out to
                where they posted the numbers and the bell rang to pay off and they put up 18.50
                after Japalac to win. That meant he paid less than even money on a ten-lira bet.</p>
            <p>We went to the bar under the grand stand and had a whiskey and soda apiece. We ran
                into a couple of Italians we knew and McAdams, the vice-consul, and they came up
                with us when we joined the girls. The Italians were full of manners and McAdams
                talked to Catherine while we went down to bet again. Mr. Meyers was standing near
                the pari-mutual.</p>
            <p>“Ask him what he played,” I said to Crowell.</p>
            <p>“What are you on, Mr. Meyers?” Crowell asked. Meyers took out his programme and
                pointed to the number five with his pencil.</p>
            <p>“Do you mind if we play him too?” Crowell asked.</p>
            <p>“Go ahead. Go ahead. But don’t tell my wife I gave it to you.”</p>
            <p>“Will you have a drink?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“No thanks. I never drink.”</p>
            <p>We put a hundred lire on number five to win and a hundred to place and then had
                another whiskey and soda apiece. I was feeling very good and we picked up a couple
                more Italians, who each had a drink with us, <pb n="140"/> and went back to the
                girls. These Italians were also very mannered and matched manners with the two we
                had collected before. In a little while no one could sit down. I gave the tickets to
                Catherine.</p>
            <p>“What horse is it?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. Mr. Meyers’ choice.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t you even know the name?”</p>
            <p>“No. You can find it on the programme. Number five I think.”</p>
            <p>“You have touching faith,” she said. The number five won but did not pay anything.
                Mr. Meyers was angry.</p>
            <p>“You have to put up two hundred lire to make twenty,” he said. “Twelve lire for ten.
                It’s not worth it. My wife lost twenty lire.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll go down with you,” Catherine said to me. The Italians all stood up. We went
                downstairs and out to the paddock.</p>
            <p>“Do you like this?” Catherine asked.</p>
            <p>“Yes. I guess I do.”</p>
            <p>“It’s all right, I suppose,” she said. “But, darling, I can’t stand to see so many
                people.”</p>
            <p>“We don’t see many.”</p>
            <p>“No. But those Meyers and the man from the bank with his wife and daughters----”</p>
            <p>“He cashes my sight drafts,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Yes but some one else would if he didn’t. Those last four boys were awful.”</p>
            <p>“We can stay out here and watch the race from the fence.”</p>
            <p>That will be lovely. And, darling, let’s back a horse we’ve never heard of and that
                Mr. Meyers won’t be backing.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>

            <pb n="141"/>

            <p>We backed a horse named Light For Me that finished fourth in a field of five. We
                leaned on the fence and watched the horses go by, their hoofs thudding as they went
                past, and saw the mountains off in the distance and Milan beyond the trees and the
                fields.</p>
            <p>“I feel so much cleaner,” Catherine said. The horses were coming back, through the
                gate, wet and sweating, the jockeys quieting them and riding up to dismount under
                the trees.</p>
            <p>“Wouldn’t you like a drink? We could have one out here and see the horses.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll get them,” I said.</p>
            <p>“The boy will bring them,” Catherine said. She put her hand up and the boy came out
                from the Pagoda bar beside the stables. We sat down at a round iron table.</p>
            <p>“Don’t you like it better when we’re alone?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I felt very lonely when they were all there.”</p>
            <p>“It’s grand here,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Yes. It’s really a pretty course.”</p>
            <p>“It’s nice.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t let me spoil your fun, darling. I’ll go back whenever you want.”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said. “We’ll stay here and have our drink. Then we’ll go down and stand at
                the water jump for the steeplechase.”</p>
            <p>“You’re awfully good to me,” she said.</p>
            <p>After we had been alone awhile we were glad to see the others again. We had a good
                time.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
            <p>In September the first cool nights came, then the days were cool and the leaves on
                the trees in the park began to turn color and we knew the summer was gone. The
                fighting at the front went very badly and they could not take San Gabriele. The
                fighting on the Bainsizza plateau was over and by the middle of the month the
                fighting for San Gabriele was about over too. They could not take it. Ettore was
                gone back to the front. The horses were gone to Rome and there was no more racing.
                Crowell had gone to Rome too, to be sent back to America. There were riots twice in
                the town against the war and bad rioting in Turin. A British major at the club told
                me the Italians had lost one hundred and fifty thousand men on the Bainsizza plateau
                and on San Gabriele. He said they had lost forty thousand on the Carso besides. We
                had a drink and he talked. He said the fighting was over for the year down here and
                that the Italians had bitten off more than they could chew. He said the offensive in
                Flanders was going to the bad. If they killed men as they did this fall the Allies
                would be cooked in another year. He said we were all cooked but we were all right as
                long as we did not know it. We were all cooked. The thing was not to recognize it.
                The last country to realize they were cooked would win the war. We had another
                drink. Was I on somebody’s staff? No. He was. It was all balls. We were alone in the
                club sitting back in one of the big leather sofas. His boots were smoothly polished
                dull leather. They were beautiful boots. He said it was all balls. They thought only
                in divisions <pb n="143"/> and man-power. They all squabbled about divisions and
                only killed them when they got them. They were all cooked. The Germans won the
                victories. By God they were soldiers. The old Hun was a soldier. But they were
                cooked too. We were all cooked. I asked about Russia. He said they were cooked
                already. I’d soon see they were cooked. Then the Austrians were cooked too. If they
                got some Hun divisions they could do it. Did he think they would attack this fall?
                Of course they would. The Italians were cooked. Everybody knew they were cooked. The
                old Hun would come down through the Trentino and cut the railway at Vicenza and then
                where would the Italians be? They tried that in ’sixteen, I said. Not with Germans.
                Yes, I said. But they probably wouldn’t do that, he said. It was too simple. They’d
                try something complicated and get royally cooked. I had to go, I said. I had to get
                back to the hospital. “Good-by,” he said. Then cheerily, “Every sort of luck!” There
                was a great contrast between his world pessimism and personal cheeriness.</p>
            <p>I stopped at a barber shop and was shaved and went home to the hospital. My leg was
                as well as it would get for a long time. I had been up for examination three days
                before. There were still some treatments to take before my course at the Ospedale
                Maggiore was finished and I walked along the side street practising not limping. An
                old man was cutting silhouettes under an arcade. I stopped to watch him. Two girls
                were posing and he cut their silhouettes together, snipping very fast and looking at
                them, his head on one side. The girls were giggling. He showed me the silhouettes
                before he pasted them on white paper and handed them to the girls.</p>

            <pb n="144"/>

            <p>“They're beautiful,” he said. “How about you, Tenente ?”</p>
            <p>The girls went away looking at their silhouettes and laughing. They were nice-looking
                girls. One of them worked in the wine shop across from the hospital.</p>
            <p>“All right,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Take your cap off.”</p>
            <p>“No. With it on.”</p>
            <p>“It will not be so beautiful,” the old man said. “But,” he brightened, “it will be
                more military.”</p>
            <p>He snipped away at the black paper, then separated the two thicknesses and pasted the
                profiles on a card and handed them to me.</p>
            <p>“How much?”</p>
            <p>“That’s all right.” He waved his hand. “I just made them for you.”</p>
            <p>“Please.” I brought out some coppers. “For pleasure.”</p>
            <p>“No. I did them for a pleasure. Give them to your girl.”</p>
            <p>“Many thanks until we meet.”</p>
            <p>“Until I see thee.”</p>
            <p>I went on to the hospital. There were some letters, an official one, and some others.
                I was to have three weeks’ convalescent leave and then return to the front. I read
                it over carefully. Well, that was that. The convalescent leave started October
                fourth when my course was finished. Three weeks was twenty-one days. That made
                October twenty-fifth. I told them I would not be in and went to the restaurant a
                little way up the street from the hospital for supper and read my letters and the
                    <hi>Corriere Della Sera</hi>; at the table. There was a letter from my
                grandfather, containing family news, <pb n="145"/> patriotic encouragement, a draft
                for two hundred dollars, and a few clippings; a dull letter from the priest at our
                mess, a letter from a man I knew who was flying with the French and had gotten in
                with a wild gang and was telling about it, and a note from Rinaldi asking me how
                long I was going to skulk in Milano and what was all the news? He wanted me to bring
                him phonograph records and enclosed a list. I drank a small bottle of chianti with
                the meal, had a coffee afterward with a glass of cognac, finished the paper, put my
                letters in my pocket, left the paper on the table with the tip and went out. In my
                room at the hospital I undressed, put on pajamas and a dressing-gown, pulled down
                the curtains on the door that opened onto the balcony and sitting up in bed read
                Boston papers from a pile Mrs. Meyers had left for her boys at the hospital. The
                Chicago White Sox were winning the American League pennant and the New York Giants
                were leading the National League. Babe Ruth was a pitcher then playing for Boston.
                The papers were dull, the news was local and stale, and the war news was all old.
                The American news was all training camps. I was glad I wasn’t in a training camp.
                The baseball news was all I could read and I did not have the slightest interest in
                it. A number of papers together made it impossible to read with interest. It was not
                very timely but I read at it for a while. I wondered if America really got into the
                war, if they would close down the major leagues. They probably wouldn’t. There was
                still racing in Milan and the war could not be much worse. They had stopped racing
                in France. That was where our horse Japalac came from. Catherine was not due on duty
                until nine o’clock. I heard her passing along the floor when she first came on duty
                and once saw her <pb n="146"/> pass in the hall. She went to several other rooms and
                finally came into mine.</p>
            <p>“I’m late, darling,” she said. “There was a lot to do. How are you?”</p>
            <p>I told her about my papers and the leave.</p>
            <p>“That’s lovely,” she said. “Where do you want to go?”</p>
            <p>“Nowhere. I want to stay here.”</p>
            <p>“That’s silly. You pick a place to go and I’ll come too.”</p>
            <p>“How will you work it ?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. But I will.”</p>
            <p>“You’re pretty wonderful.”</p>
            <p>“No I’m not. But life isn’t hard to manage when you’ve nothing to lose.”</p>
            <p>“How do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“Nothing. I was only thinking how small obstacles seemed that once were so big.”</p>
            <p>“I should think it might be hard to manage.”</p>
            <p>“No it won’t, darling. If necessary I’ll simply leave. But it won’t come to
                that.”</p>
            <p>“Where should we go?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t care. Anywhere you want. Anywhere we don’t know people.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t you care where we go?”</p>
            <p>“No. I’ll like any place.”</p>
            <p>She seemed upset and taut.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter, Catherine ?”</p>
            <p>“Nothing. Nothing’s the matter.”</p>
            <p>“Yes there is.”</p>
            <p>“No nothing. Really nothing.”</p>
            <p>“I know there is. Tell me, darling. You can tell me.”</p>
            <p>“It’s nothing.”</p>

            <pb n="147"/>

            <p>“Tell me.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t want to. I’m afraid I’ll make you unhappy or worry you.”</p>
            <p>“No it won’t.”</p>
            <p>“You’re sure? It doesn’t worry me but I’m afraid to worry you.”</p>
            <p>“It won’t if it doesn’t worry you.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t want to tell.”</p>
            <p>“Tell it”</p>
            <p>“Do I have to?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“I’m going to have a baby, darling. It’s almost three months along. You’re not
                worried, are you? Please please don’t. You mustn’t worry.”</p>
            <p>“All right.”</p>
            <p>“Is it all right?”</p>
            <p>“Of course.”</p>
            <p>“I did everything. I took everything but it didn’t make any difference.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not worried.”</p>
            <p>“I couldn’t help it, darling, and I haven’t worried about it. You mustn’t worry or
                feel badly.”</p>
            <p>“I only worry about you.”</p>
            <p>“That’s it. That’s what you mustn’t do. People have babies all the time. Everybody
                has babies. It’s a natural thing.”</p>
            <p>“You’re pretty wonderful.”</p>
            <p>“No I’m not. But you mustn’t mind, darling. I’ll try and not make trouble for you. I
                know I’ve made trouble now. But haven’t I been a good girl until now ? You never
                knew it, did you?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“It will all be like that. You simply mustn’t worry. I can see you’re worrying. Stop
                it. Stop it right away. <pb n="148"/> Wouldn’t you like a drink, darling? I know a
                drink always makes you feel cheerful.”</p>
            <p>“No. I feel cheerful. And you’re pretty wonderful.”</p>
            <p>“No I’m not. But I’ll fix everything to be together if you pick out a place for us to
                go. It ought to be lovely in October. We’ll have a lovely time, darling, and I’ll
                write you every day while you’re at the front.”</p>
            <p>“Where will you be?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know yet. But somewhere splendid. I’ll look after all that.”</p>
            <p>We were quiet awhile and did not talk. Catherine was sitting on the bed and I was
                looking at her but we did not touch each other. We were apart as when some one comes
                into a room and people are self-conscious. She put out her hand and took mine.</p>
            <p>“You aren’t angry are you, darling?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“And you don’t feel trapped?”</p>
            <p>“Maybe a little. But not by you.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t mean by me. You mustn’t be stupid. I meant trapped at all.”</p>
            <p>“You always feel trapped biologically.”</p>
            <p>She went away a long way without stirring or removing her hand.</p>
            <p>“‘Always’ isn’t a pretty word.”</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
            <p>“It’s all right. But you see I’ve never had a baby and I’ve never even loved any one.
                And I’ve tried to be the way you wanted and then you talk about ‘always.’”</p>
            <p>“I could cut off my tongue,” I offered.</p>
            <p>“Oh, darling!” she came back from wherever she had been. “You mustn’t mind me.” We
                were both together again and the self-consciousness was gone. “We <pb n="149"/>
                really are the same one and we mustn’t misunderstand on purpose.”</p>
            <p>“We won’t”</p>
            <p>“But people do. They love each other and they misunderstand on purpose and they fight
                and then suddenly they aren’t the same one.”</p>
            <p>“We won’t fight.”</p>
            <p>“We mustn’t. Because there’s only us two and in the world there’s all the rest of
                them. If anything comes between us we’re gone and then they have us.”</p>
            <p>“They won’t get us,” I said. “Because you’re too brave. Nothing ever happens to the
                brave.”</p>
            <p>“They die of course.”</p>
            <p>“But only once.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. Who said that?”</p>
            <p>“The coward dies a thousand deaths, the brave but one?”</p>
            <p>“Of course. Who said it?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
            <p>“He was probably a coward,” she said. “He knew a great deal about cowards but nothing
                about the brave. The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths if he’s intelligent. He
                simply doesn’t mention them.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. It’s hard to see inside the head of the brave.”</p>
            <p>“Yes. That’s how they keep that way.”</p>
            <p>“You’re an authority.”</p>
            <p>“You’re right, darling. That was deserved.”</p>
            <p>“You’re brave.”</p>
            <p>“No,” she said. “But I would like to be.”</p>
            <p>“I’m not,” I said, “I know where I stand. I’ve been out long enough to know. I’m like
                a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty and knows he’s no better.”</p>

            <pb n="150"/>

            <p>“What is a ball-player that bats two hundred and thirty? It’s awfully
                impressive.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not. It means a mediocre hitter in baseball.”</p>
            <p>“But still a hitter,” she prodded me.</p>
            <p>“I guess we’re both conceited,” I said. “But you are brave.”</p>
            <p>“No. But I hope to be.”</p>
            <p>“We’re both brave,” I said. “And I’m very brave when I’ve had a drink.”</p>
            <p>“We’re splendid people,” Catherine said. She went over to the armoire and brought me
                the cognac and a glass. “Have a drink, darling,” she said. “You’ve been awfully
                good.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t really want one.”</p>
            <p>“Take one.”</p>
            <p>“All right.” I poured the water glass a third full of cognac and drank it off.</p>
            <p>“That was very big,” she said. “I know brandy is for heroes. But you shouldn’t
                exaggerate.”</p>
            <p>“Where will we live after the war?”</p>
            <p>“In an old people’s home probably,” she said. “For three years I looked forward very
                childishly to the war ending at Christmas. But now I look forward till when our son
                will be a lieutenant commander.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe he’ll be a general.”</p>
            <p>“If it’s an hundred years’ war he’ll have time to try both of the services.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t you want a drink?”</p>
            <p>“No. It always makes you happy, darling, and it only makes me dizzy.”</p>
            <p>“Didn’t you ever drink brandy?”</p>
            <p>‘No, darling. I’m a very old-fashioned wife.”</p>
            <p>I reached down to the floor for the bottle and poured another drink.</p>

            <pb n="151"/>

            <p>“I’d better go to have a look at your compatriots,” Catherine said. “Perhaps you’ll
                read the papers until I come back.”</p>
            <p>“Do you have to go?”</p>
            <p>“Now or later.”</p>
            <p>“All right. Now.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll come back later.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll have finished the papers,” I said.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXII</head>
            <p>It turned cold that night and the next day it was raining. Coming home from the
                Ospedale Maggiore it rained very hard and I was wet when I came in. Up in my room
                the rain was coming down heavily outside on the balcony, and the wind blew it
                against the glass doors. I changed my clothing and drank some brandy but the brandy
                did not taste good. I felt sick in the night and in the morning after breakfast I
                was nauseated.</p>
            <p>“There is no doubt about it,” the house surgeon said. “Look at the whites of his
                eyes, Miss.”</p>
            <p>Miss Gage looked. They had me look in a glaSs. The whites of the eyes were yellow and
                it was the jaundice. I was sick for two weeks with it. For that reason we did not
                spend a convalescent leave together. We had planned to go to Pallanza on Lago
                Maggiore. It is nice there in the fall when the leaves turn. There are walks you can
                take and you can troll for trout in the lake. It would have been better than Stresa
                because there are fewer people at Pallanza. Stresa is so easy to get to from Milan
                that there are always people you know. There is a nice village at Pallanza and you
                can row out to the islands where the fishermen live and there is a restaurant on the
                biggest island. But we did not go.</p>
            <p>One day while I was in bed with jaundice Miss Van Campen came in the room, opened the
                door into the armoire and saw the empty bottles there. I had sent a load of them
                down by the porter and I believe she must have seen them going out and come up to
                find some <pb n="153"/> more. They were mostly vermouth bottles, marsala bottles,
                capri bottles, empty chianti flasks and a few cognac bottles. The porter had carried
                out the large bottles, those that had held vermouth, and the straw-covered chianti
                flasks, and left the brandy bottles for the last. It was the brandy bottles and a
                bottle shaped like a bear, which had held kümmel, that Miss Van Campen found. The
                bear-shaped bottle enraged her particularly. She held it up, the bear was sitting up
                on his haunches with his paws up, there was a cork in his glass head and a few
                sticky crystals at the bottom. I laughed.</p>
            <p>“It was kümmel,” I said. “The best kümmel comes in those bear-shaped bottles. It
                comes from Russia.”</p>
            <p>“Those are all brandy bottles, aren’t they?” Miss Van Campen asked.</p>
            <p>“I can’t see them all,” I said. “But they probably are.</p>
            <p>“How long has this been going on?”</p>
            <p>“I bought them and brought them in myself,” I said. “I have had Italian officers
                visit me frequently and I have kept brandy to offer them.”</p>
            <p>“You haven’t been drinking it yourself?” she said.</p>
            <p>“I have also drunk it myself.”</p>
            <p>“Brandy,” she said. “Eleven empty bottles of brandy and that bear liquid.”</p>
            <p>“Kümmel.”</p>
            <p>“I will send for some one to take them away. Those are all the empty bottles you
                have?”</p>
            <p>“For the moment.”</p>
            <p>“And I was pitying you having jaundice. Pity is something that is wasted on you.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you.”</p>
            <p>“I suppose you can’t be blamed for not wanting to go back to the front. But I should
                think you would <pb n="154"/> try something more intelligent than producing jaundice
                with alcoholism.”</p>
            <p>“With what?”</p>
            <p>“With alcoholism. You heard me say it.” I did not say anything. “Unless you find
                something else I’m afraid you will have to go back to the front when you are through
                with your jaundice. I don’t believe self-inflicted jaundice entitles you to a
                convalescent leave.”</p>
            <p>“You don’t?”</p>
            <p>“I do not.”</p>
            <p>“Have you ever had jaundice, Miss Van Campen?” “No, but I have seen a great deal of
                it.”</p>
            <p>“You noticed how the patients enjoyed it?”</p>
            <p>“I suppose it is better than the front.”</p>
            <p>“Miss Van Campen,” I said, “did you ever know a man who tried to disable himself by
                kicking himself in the scrotum?”</p>
            <p>Miss Van Campen ignored the actual question. She had to ignore it or leave the room.
                She was not ready to leave because she had disliked me for a long time and she was
                now cashing in.</p>
            <p>“I have known many men to escape the front through self-inflicted wounds.”</p>
            <p>“That wasn’t the question. I have seen self-inflicted wounds also. I asked you if you
                had ever known a man who had tried to disable himself by kicking himself in the
                scrotum. Because that is the nearest sensation to jaundice and it is a sensation
                that I believe few women have ever experienced. That was why I asked you if you had
                ever had the jaundice, Miss Van Campen, because--” Miss Van Campen left the room.
                Later Miss Gage came in.</p>

            <pb n="155"/>

            <p>“What did you say to Van Campen? She was furious.”</p>
            <p>“We were comparing sensations. I was going to suggest that she had never experienced
                childbirth----”</p>
            <p>“You’re a fool,” Gage said. “She’s after your scalp.”</p>
            <p>“She has my scalp,” I said. “She’s lost me my leave and she might try and get me
                court-martialled. She’s mean enough.”</p>
            <p>“She never liked you,” Gage said. “What’s it about ?”</p>
            <p>“She says I’ve drunk myself into jaundice so as not to go back to the front.”</p>
            <p>“Pooh,” said Gage. “I’ll swear you’ve never taken a drink. Everybody will swear
                you’ve never taken a drink.”</p>
            <p>“She found the bottles.”</p>
            <p>“I’ve told you a hundred times to clear out those bottles. Where are they now?”</p>
            <p>“In the armoire.”</p>
            <p>“Have you a suitcase ?”</p>
            <p>“No. Put them in that rucksack.”</p>
            <p>Miss Gage packed the bottles in the rucksack. “I’ll give them to the porter,” she
                said. She started for the door.</p>
            <p>“Just a minute,” Miss Van Campen said. “I’ll take those bottles.” She had the porter
                with her. “Carry them, please,” she said. “I want to show them to the doctor when I
                make my report.”</p>
            <p>She went down the hall. The porter carried the sack. He knew what was in it.</p>
            <p>Nothing happened except that I lost my leave.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
            <p>The night I was to return to the front I sent the porter down to hold a seat for me
                on the train when it came from Turin. The train was to leave at midnight. It was
                made up at Turin and reached Milan about halfpast ten at night and lay in the
                station until time to leave. You had to be there when it came in, to get a seat. The
                porter took a friend with him, a machine-gunner on leave who worked in a tailor
                shop, and was sure that between them they could hold a place. I gave them money for
                platform tickets and had them take my baggage. There was a big rucksack and two
                musettes.</p>
            <p>I said good-by at the hospital at about five o’clock and went out. The porter had my
                baggage in his lodge and I told him I would be at the station a little before
                midnight. His wife called me “Signorino” and cried. She wiped her eyes and shook
                hands and then cried again. I patted her on the back and she cried once more. She
                had done my mending and was a very short dumpy, happy-faced woman with white hair.
                When she cried her whole face went to pieces. I went down to the corner where there
                was a wine shop and waited inside looking out the window. It was dark outside and
                cold and misty. I paid for my coffee and grappa and I watched the people going by in
                the light from the window. I saw Catherine and knocked on the window. She looked,
                saw me and smiled, and I went out to meet her. She was wearing a dark blue cape and
                a soft felt hat. We walked along together, along the sidewalk past the wine shops,
                then across the market square and up the street and through the archway to the
                cathedral <pb n="157"/> square. There were streetcar tracks and beyond them was the
                cathedral. It was white and wet in the mist. We crossed the tram tracks. On our left
                were the shops, their windows lighted, and the entrance to the galleria. There was a
                fog in the square and when we came close to the front of the cathedral it was very
                big and the stone was wet.</p>
            <p>“Would you like to go in?”</p>
            <p>“No,” Catherine said. We walked along. There was a soldier standing with his girl in
                the shadow of one of the stone buttresses ahead of us and we passed them. They were
                standing tight up against the stone and he had put his cape around her.</p>
            <p>“They’re like us,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Nobody is like us,” Catherine said. She did not mean it happily.</p>
            <p>“I wish they had some place to go.”</p>
            <p>“It mightn’t do them any good.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. Everybody ought to have some place to go.”</p>
            <p>“They have the cathedral,” Catherine said. We were past it now. We crossed the far
                end of the square and looked back at the cathedral. It was fine in the mist. We were
                standing in front of the leather goods shop. There were riding boots, a rucksack and
                ski boots in the window. Each article was set apart as an exhibit; the rucksack in
                the centre, the riding boots on one side and the ski boots on the other. The leather
                was dark and oiled smooth as a used saddle. The electric light made high lights on
                the dull oiled leather.</p>
            <p>“We’ll ski some time.”</p>
            <p>“In two months there will be ski-ing at Mürren,” Catherine said.</p>
            <p>“Let’s go there.”</p>

            <pb n="158"/>

            <p>“All right,” she said. We went on past other windows and turned down a side
                street.</p>
            <p>“I’ve never been this way.”</p>
            <p>“This is the way I go to the hospital,” I said. It was a narrow street and we kept on
                the right-hand side. There were many people passing in the fog. There were shops and
                all the windows were lighted. We looked in a window at a pile of cheeses. I stopped
                in front of an armorer’s shop.</p>
            <p>“Come in a minute. I have to buy a gun.”</p>
            <p>“What sort of gun?”</p>
            <p>“A pistol.” We went in and I unbuttoned my belt and laid it with the empty holster on
                the counter. Two women were behind the counter. The women brought out several
                pistols.</p>
            <p>“It must fit this,” I said, opening the holster. It was a gray leather holster and I
                had bought it secondhand to wear in the town.</p>
            <p>“Have they good pistols ?” Catherine asked.</p>
            <p>“They’re all about the same. Can I try this one?” I asked the woman.</p>
            <p>“I have no place now to shoot,” she said. “But it is very good. You will not make a
                mistake with it.”</p>
            <p>I snapped it and pulled back the action. The spring was rather strong but it worked
                smoothly. I sighted it and snapped it again.</p>
            <p>“It is used,” the woman said. “It belonged to an officer who was an excellent
                shot.”</p>
            <p>“Did you sell it to him?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>“How did you get it back?”</p>
            <p>“From his orderly.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe you have mine,” I said. “How much is this?”</p>

            <pb n="159"/>

            <p>“Fifty lire. It is very cheap.”</p>
            <p>“All right. I want two extra clips and a box of cartridges.”</p>
            <p>She brought them from under the counter.</p>
            <p>“Have you any need for a sword?” she asked. “I have some used swords very cheap.”</p>
            <p>“I’m going to the front,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Oh yes, then you won’t need a sword,” she said.</p>
            <p>I paid for the cartridges and the pistol, filled the magazine and put it in place,
                put the pistol in my empty holster, filled the extra clips with cartridges and put
                them in the leather slots on the holster and then buckled on my belt. The pistol
                felt heavy on the belt. Still, I thought, it was better to have a regulation pistol.
                You could always get shells.</p>
            <p>“Now we’re fully armed,” I said. “That was the one thing I had to remember to do.
                Some one got my other one going to the hospital.”</p>
            <p>“I hope it’s a good pistol,” Catherine said.</p>
            <p>“Was there anything else?” the woman asked.</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe so.”</p>
            <p>“The pistol has a lanyard,” she said.</p>
            <p>“So I noticed.” The woman wanted to sell something else.</p>
            <p>“You don’t need a whistle?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t believe so.”</p>
            <p>The woman said good-by and we went out onto the sidewalk. Catherine looked in the
                window. The woman looked out and bowed to us.</p>
            <p>“What are those little mirrors set in wood for?”</p>
            <p>“They’re for attracting birds. They twirl them out in the field and larks see them
                and come out and the Italians shoot them.”</p>
            <p>“They are an ingenious people,” Catherine said. <pb n="160"/> “You don’t shoot larks
                do you, darling, in America?”</p>
            <p>“Not especially.”</p>
            <p>We crossed the street and started to walk up the other side.</p>
            <p>“I feel better now,” Catherine said. “I felt terrible when we started.”</p>
            <p>“We always feel good when we’re together.”</p>
            <p>“We always will be together.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, except that I’m going away at midnight.”</p>
            <p>“Don’t think about it, darling.”</p>
            <p>We walked on up the street. The fog made the lights yellow.</p>
            <p>“Aren’t you tired?” Catherine asked.</p>
            <p>“How about you?”</p>
            <p>“I’m all right. It’s fun to walk.”</p>
            <p>“But let’s not do it too long.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>We turned down a side street where there were no lights and walked in the street. I
                stopped and kissed Catherine. While I kissed her I felt her hand on my shoulder. She
                had pulled my cape around her so it covered both of us. We were standing in the
                street against a high wall.</p>
            <p>“Let’s go some place,” I said.</p>
            <p>“Good,” said Catherine. We walked on along the street until it came out onto a wider
                street that was beside a canal. On the other side was a brick wall and buildings.
                Ahead, down the street, I saw a street-car cross a bridge.</p>
            <p>“We can get a cab up at the bridge,” I said. We stood on the bridge in the fog
                waiting for a carriage. Several street-cars passed, full of people going home. Then
                a carriage came along but there was some one in it. The fog was turning to rain.</p>

            <pb n="161"/>

            <p>“We could walk or take a tram,” Catherine said.</p>

            <p>“One will be along,” I said. “They go by here.” “Here one comes,” she said.</p>
            <p>The driver stopped his horse and lowered the metal sign on his meter. The top of the
                carriage was up and there were drops of water on the driver’s coat. His varnished
                hat was shining in the wet. We sat back in the seat together and the top of the
                carriage made it dark.</p>
            <p>“Where did you tell him to go?”</p>
            <p>“To the station. There’s a hotel across from the station where we can go.”</p>
            <p>“We can go the way we are? Without luggage?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
            <p>It was a long ride to the station up side streets in the rain.</p>
            <p>“Won’t we have dinner?” Catherine asked. “I’m afraid I’ll be hungry.”</p>
            <p>“We’ll have it in our room.”</p>
            <p>“I haven’t anything to wear. I haven’t even a nightgown.”</p>
            <p>“We’ll get one,” I said and called to the driver.</p>
            <p>“Go to the Via Manzoni and up that.” He nodded and turned off to the left at the next
                corner. On the big street Catherine watched for a shop.</p>
            <p>“Here’s a place,” she said. I stopped the driver and Catherine got out, walked across
                the sidewalk and went inside. I sat back in the carriage and waited for her. It was
                raining and I could smell the wet street and the horse steaming in the rain. She
                came back with a package and got in and we drove on.</p>
            <p>“I was very extravagant, darling,” she said, “but it’s a fine nightgown.”</p>
            <p>At the hotel I asked Catherine to wait in the carriage <pb n="162"/> while I went in
                and spoke to the manager. There were plenty of rooms. Then I went out to the
                carriage, paid the driver, and Catherine and I walked in together. The small boy in
                buttons carried the package. The manager bowed us toward the elevator. There was
                much red plush and brass. The manager went up in the elevator with us.</p>
            <p>“Monsieur and Madame wish dinner in their room?”</p>
            <p>“Yes. Will you have the menu brought up?” I said.</p>
            <p>“You wish something special for dinner. Some game or a soufflet?”</p>
            <p>The elevator passed three floors with a click each time, then clicked and
                stopped.</p>
            <p>“What have you as game ?”</p>
            <p>“I could get a pheasant, or a woodcock.”</p>
            <p>“A woodcock,” I said. We walked down the corridor. The carpet was worn. There were
                many doors. The manager stopped and unlocked a door and opened it.</p>
            <p>“Here you are. A lovely room.”</p>
            <p>The small boy in buttons put the package on the table in the centre of the room. The
                manager opened the curtains.</p>
            <p>“It is foggy outside,” he said. The room was furnished in red plush. There were many
                mirrors, two chairs and a large bed with a satin coverlet. A door led to the
                bathroom.</p>
            <p>“I will send up the menu,” the manager said. He bowed and went out.</p>
            <p>I went to the window and looked out, then pulled a cord that shut the thick plush
                curtains. Catherine was sitting on the bed, looking at the cut glass chandelier. She
                had taken her hat off and her hair shone under the light. She saw herself in one of
                the mirrors and put her hands to her hair. I saw her in three other
                    mirrors.
                <pb n="163"/> She did not look happy. She let her cape fall on the bed.</p>
            <p>“What’s the matter, darling ?”</p>
            <p>“I never felt like a whore before,” she said. I went over to the window and pulled
                the curtain aside and looked out. I had not thought it would be like this.</p>
            <p>“You’re not a whore.”</p>
            <p>“I know it, darling. But it isn’t nice to feel like one.” Her voice was dry and
                flat.</p>
            <p>“This was the best hotel we could get in,” I said. I looked out the window. Across
                the square were the lights of the station. There were carriages going by on the
                street and I saw the trees in the park. The lights from the hotel shone on the wet
                pavement. Oh, hell, I thought, do we have to argue now ?</p>
            <p>“Come over here please,” Catherine said. The flatness was all gone out of her voice.
                “Come over, please. I’m a good girl again.” I looked over at the bed. She was
                smiling.</p>
            <p>I went over and sat on the bed beside her and kissed her.</p>
            <p>“You’re my good girl.”</p>
            <p>“I’m certainly yours,” she said.</p>
            <p>After we had eaten we felt fine, and then after, we felt very happy and in a little
                time the room felt like our own home. My room at the hospital had been our own home
                and this room was our home too in the same way.</p>
            <p>Catherine wore my tunic over her shoulders while we ate. We were very hungry and the
                meal was good and we drank a bottle of Capri and a bottle of St. Estephe. I drank
                most of it but Catherine drank some and it made her feel splendid. For dinner we had
                a <pb n="164"/> woodcock with soufflé potatoes and purée de marron, a salad, and
                zabaione for dessert.</p>
            <p>“It’s a fine room,” Catherine said. “It’s a lovely room. We should have stayed here
                all the time we’ve been in Milan.”</p>
            <p>“It’s a funny room. But it’s nice.”</p>
            <p>“Vice is a wonderful thing,” Catherine said. “The people who go in for it seem to
                have good taste about it. The red plush is really fine. It’s just the thing. And the
                mirrors are very attractive.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a lovely girl.”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know how a room like this would be for waking up in the morning. But it’s
                really a splendid room.” I poured another glass of St. Estephe.</p>
            <p>“I wish we could do something really sinful,” Catherine said. “Everything we do seems
                so innocent and simple. I can’t believe we do anything wrong.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a grand girl.”</p>
            <p>“I only feel hungry. I get terribly hungry.”</p>
            <p>“You’re a fine simple girl,” I said.</p>
            <p>“I am a simple girl. No one ever understood it except you.”</p>
            <p>“Once when I first met you I spent an afternoon thinking how we would go to the Hotel
                Cavour together and how it would be.”</p>
            <p>“That was awfully cheeky of you. This isn’t the Cavour is it?”</p>
            <p>“No. They wouldn’t have taken us in there.”</p>
            <p>“They’ll take us in some time. But that’s how we differ, darling. I never thought
                about anything.”</p>
            <p>“Didn’t you ever at all?”</p>
            <p>“A little,” she said.</p>
            <p>“Oh you’re a lovely girl.”</p>
            <p>I poured another glass of wine.</p>

            <pb n="165"/>

            <p>“I’m a very simple girl,” Catherine said.</p>
            <p>“I didn’t think so at first. I thought you were a crazy girl.”</p>
            <p>“I was a little crazy. But I wasn’t crazy in any complicated manner. I didn’t confuse
                you did I, darling?”</p>
            <p>“Wine is a grand thing,” I said. “It makes you forget all the bad.”</p>
            <p>“It’s lovely,” said Catherine. “But it’s given my father gout very badly.”</p>
            <p>“Have you a father?”</p>
            <p>“Yes,” said Catherine. “He has gout. You won’t ever have to meet him. Haven’t you a
                father ?”</p>
            <p>“No,” I said. “A step-father.”</p>
            <p>“Will I like him?”</p>
            <p>“You won’t have to meet him.”</p>
            <p>“We have such a fine time,” Catherine said. “I don’t take any interest in anything
                else any more. I’m so very happy married to you.”</p>
            <p>The waiter came and took away the things. After a while we were very still and we
                could hear the rain. Down below on the street a motor car honked.</p>
            <p><quote xml:lang="eng">“‘But at my back I always hear<lb/>
                Time’s winged chariot hurrying near,’”</quote> I
                said.</p>
            <p>“I know that poem,” Catherine said. “It’s by Marvell. But it’s about a girl who
                wouldn’t live with a man.”</p>
            <p>My head felt very clear and cold and I wanted to talk facts.</p>
            <p>“Where will you have the baby?”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know. The best place I can find.”</p>
            <p>“How will you arrange it?”</p>
            <p>“The best way I can. Don’t worry, darling. We may have several babies before the war
                is over.”</p>

            <pb n="166"/>

            <p>“It’s nearly time to go.”</p>
            <p>“I know. You can make it time if you want.”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Then don’t worry, darling. You were fine until now and now you’re worrying.”</p>
            <p>“I won’t. How often will you write?”</p>
            <p>“Every day. Do they read your letters?”</p>
            <p>“They can’t read English enough to hurt any.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll make them very confusing,” Catherine said.</p>
            <p>“But not too confusing.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll just make them a little confusing.”</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid we have to start to go.”</p>
            <p>“All right, darling.”</p>
            <p>“I hate to leave our fine house.”</p>
            <p>“So do I.”</p>
            <p>“But we have to go.”</p>
            <p>“All right. But we’re never settled in our home very long.”</p>
            <p>“We will be.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll have a fine home for you when you come back.”</p>
            <p>“Maybe I’ll be back right away.”</p>
            <p>“Perhaps you’ll be hurt just a little in the foot.”</p>
            <p>“Or the lobe of the ear.”</p>
            <p>“No I want your ears the way they are.”</p>
            <p>“And not my feet?”</p>
            <p>“Your feet have been hit already.”</p>
            <p>“We have to go, darling. Really.”</p>
            <p>“All right. You go first.”</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
            <p>We walked down the stairs instead of taking the elevator. The carpet on the stairs
                was worn. I had paid for the dinner when it came up and the waiter, who had brought
                it, was sitting on a chair near the door. He jumped up and bowed and I went with him
                into the side room and paid the bill for the room. The manager had remembered me as
                a friend and refused payment in advance but when he retired he had remembered to
                have the waiter stationed at the door so that I should not get out without paying. I
                suppose that had happened; even with his friends. One had so many friends in a
                war.</p>
            <p>I asked the waiter to get us a carriage and he took Catherine’s package that I was
                carrying and went out with an umbrella. Outside through the window we saw him
                crossing the street in the rain. We stood in the side room and looked out the
                window.</p>
            <p>“How do you feel, Cat ?”</p>
            <p>“Sleepy.”</p>
            <p>“I feel hollow and hungry.”</p>
            <p>“Have you anything to eat?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, in my musette.”</p>
            <p>I saw the carriage coming. It stopped, the horse’s head hanging in the rain, and the
                waiter stepped out, opened his umbrella, and came toward the hotel. We met him at
                the door and walked out under the umbrella down the wet walk to the carriage at the
                curb. Water was running in the gutter.</p>
            <p>“There is your package on the seat,” the waiter said. He stood with the umbrella
                until we were in and I had tipped him.</p>

            <pb n="168"/>

            <p>“Many thanks. Pleasant journey,” he said. The coachman lifted the reins and the horse
                started. The waiter turned away under the umbrella and went toward the hotel. We
                drove down the street and turned to the left, then came around to the right in front
                of the station. There were two carabinieri standing under the light just out of the
                rain. The light shone on their hats. The rain was clear and transparent against the
                light from the station. A porter came out from under the shelter of the station, his
                shoulders up against the rain.</p>
            <p>“No,” I said. “Thanks. I don’t need thee.”</p>
            <p>He went back under the shelter of the archway. I turned to Catherine. Her face was in
                the shadow from the hood of the carriage.</p>
            <p>“We might as well say good-by.”</p>
            <p>“I can’t go in?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by, Cat.”</p>
            <p>“Will you tell him the hospital?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>I told the driver the address to drive to. He nodded.</p>
            <p>“Good-by,” I said. “Take good care of yourself and young Catherine.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by, darling.”</p>
            <p>“Good-by,” I said. I stepped out into the rain and the carriage started. Catherine
                leaned out and I saw her face in the light. She smiled and waved. The carriage went
                up the street, Catherine pointed in toward the archway. I looked, there were only
                the two carabinieri and the archway. I realized she meant for me to get in out of
                the rain. I went in and stood and watched the carriage turn the corner. Then I
                started <pb n="169"/> through the station and down the runway to the train.</p>
            <p>The porter was on the platform looking for me. I followed him into the train,
                crowding past people and along the aisle and in through a door to where the
                machine-gunner sat in the corner of a full compartment. My rucksack and musettes
                were above his head on the luggage rack. There were many men standing in the
                corridor and the men in the compartment all looked at us when we came in. There were
                not enough places in the train and every one was hostile. The machine-gunner stood
                up for me to sit down. Some one tapped me on the shoulder. I looked around. It was a
                very tall gaunt captain of artillery with a red scar along his jaw. He had looked
                through the glass on the corridor and then come in.</p>
            <p>“What do you say?” I asked. I had turned and faced him. He was taller than I and his
                face was very thin under the shadow of his cap-visor and the scar was new and shiny.
                Every one in the compartment was looking at me.</p>
            <p>“You can’t do that,” he said. “You can’t have a soldier save you a place.”</p>
            <p>“I have done it.”</p>
            <p>He swallowed and I saw his Adam’s apple go up and then down. The machine-gunner stood
                in front of the place. Other men looked in through the glass. No one in the
                compartment said anything.</p>
            <p>“You have no right to do that. I was here two hours before you came.”</p>
            <p>“What do you want?”</p>
            <p>“The seat.”</p>
            <p>“So do I.”</p>
            <p>I watched his face and could feel the whole compartment against me. I did not blame
                them. He was <pb n="170"/> in the right. But I wanted the seat. Still no one said
                anything.</p>
            <p>Oh, hell, I thought.</p>
            <p>“Sit down, Signor Capitano,” I said. The machine-gunner moved out of the way and the
                tall captain sat down. He looked at me. His face seemed hurt. But he had the seat.
                “Get my things,” I said to the machine-gunner. We went out in the corridor. The
                train was full and I knew there was no chance of a place. I gave the porter and the
                machine-gunner ten lire apiece. They went down the corridor and outside on the
                platform looking in the windows but there were no places.</p>
            <p>“Maybe some will get off at Brescia,” the porter said.</p>
            <p>“More will get on at Brescia,” said the machine-gunner. I said good-by to them and we
                shook hands and they left. They both felt badly. Inside the train we were all
                standing in the corridor when the train started. I watched the lights of the station
                and the yards as we went out. It was still raining and soon the windows were wet and
                you could not see out. Later I slept on the floor of the corridor; first putting my
                pocket-book with my money and papers in it inside my shirt and trousers so that it
                was inside the leg of my breeches. I slept all night, waking at Brescia and Verona
                when more men got on the train, but going back to sleep at once. I had my head on
                one of the musettes and my arms around the other and I could feel the pack and they
                could all walk over me if they wouldn’t step on me. Men were sleeping on the floor
                all down the corridor. Others stood holding on to the window rods or leaning against
                the doors. That train was always crowded.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
        <p>Now in the fall the trees were all bare and the roads were muddy. I rode to Gorizia from
            Udine on a camion. We passed other camions on the road and I looked at the country. The
            mulberry trees were bare and the fields were brown. There were wet dead leaves on the
            road from the rows of bare trees and men were working on the road, tamping stone in the
            ruts from piles of crushed stone along the side of the road between the trees. We saw
            the town with a mist over it that cut off the mountains. We crossed the river and I saw
            that it was running high. It had been raining in the mountains. We came into the town
            past the factories and then the houses and villas and I saw that many more houses had
            been hit. On a narrow street we passed a British Red Cross ambulance. The driver wore a
            cap and his face was thin and very tanned. I did not know him. I got down from the
            camion in the big square in front of the Town Major’s house, the driver handed down my
            rucksack and I put it on and swung on the two musettes and walked to our villa. It did
            not feel like a homecoming.</p>
        <p>I walked down the damp gravel driveway looking at the villa through the trees. The
            windows were all shut but the door was open. I went in and found the major sitting at a
            table in the bare room with maps and typed sheets of paper on the wall.</p>
        <p>“Hello,” he said. “How are you?” He looked older and drier.</p>
        <p>“I’m good,” I said. “How is everything?”</p>
        <p>“It’s all over,” he said. “Take off your kit and sit
            
            <pb n="174"/>
            
            down.” I put my pack and the two musettes on the floor and my cap on the pack. I brought
            the other chair over from the wall and sat down by the desk.</p>
        <p>“It’s been a bad summer,” the major said. “Are you strong now ?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Did you ever get the decorations?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. I got them fine. Thank you very much.” “Let’s see them.”</p>
        <p>I opened my cape so he could see the two ribbons.</p>
        <p>“Did you get the boxes with the medals?”</p>
        <p>“No. Just the papers.”</p>
        <p>“The boxes will come later. That takes more time.”</p>
        <p>“What do you want me to do?”</p>
        <p>“The cars are all away. There are six up north at Caporetto. You know Caporetto?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said. I remembered it as a little white town with a campanile in a valley. It
            was a clean little town and there was a fine fountain in the square.</p>
        <p>“They are working from there. There are many sick now. The fighting is over.”</p>
        <p>“Where are the others?”</p>
        <p>“There are two up in the mountains and four still on the Bainsizza. The other two
            ambulance sections are in the Carso with the third army.”</p>
        <p>“What do you wish me to do ?”</p>
        <p>“You can go and take over the four cars on the Bainsizza if you like. Gino has been up
            there a long time. You haven’t seen it up there, have you?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“It was very bad. We lost three cars.”</p>
        <p>“I heard about it.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Rinaldi wrote you.”</p>
            
            <pb n="175"/>
            
        <p>“Where is Rinaldi?”</p>
        <p>“He is here at the hospital. He has had a summer and fall of it.”</p>
        <p>“I believe it.”</p>
        <p>“It has been bad,” the major said. “You couldn’t believe how bad it’s been. I’ve often
            thought you were lucky to be hit when you were.”</p>
        <p>“I know I was.”</p>
        <p>“Next year will be worse,” the major said. “Perhaps they will attack now. They say they
            are to attack but I can’t believe it. It is too late. You saw the river ?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. It’s high already.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe they will attack now that the rains have started. We will have the snow
            soon. What about your countrymen? Will there be other Americans besides yourself?”</p>
        <p>“They are training an army of ten million.”</p>
        <p>“I hope we get some of them. But the French will hog them all. We’ll never get any down
            here. All right. You stay here to-night and go out to-morrow with the little car and
            send Gino back. I’ll send somebody with you that knows the road. Gino will tell you
            everything. They are shelling quite a little still but it is all over. You will want to
            see the Bainsizza.”</p>
        <p>“I’m glad to see it. I am glad to be back with you again, Signor Maggiore.”</p>
        <p>He smiled. “You are very good to say so. I am very tired of this war. If I was away I do
            not believe I would come back.”</p>
        <p>“Is it so bad?”</p>
        <p>“Yes. It is so bad and worse. Go get cleaned up and find your friend Rinaldi.”</p>
        <p>I went out and carried my bags up the stairs. Rinaldi 
            
            <pb n="176"/>
            
         was not in the room but his things were there and I sat down on the bed and
            unwrapped my puttees and took the shoe off my right foot. Then I lay back on the bed. I
            was tired and my right foot hurt. It seemed silly to lie on the bed with one shoe off,
            so I sat up and unlaced the other shoe and dropped it on the floor, then lay back on the
            blanket again. The room was stuffy with the window closed but I was too tired to get up
            and open it. I saw my things were all in one corner of the room. Outside it was getting
            dark. I lay on the bed and thought about Catherine and waited for Rinaldi. I was going
            to try not to think about Catherine except at night before I went to sleep. But now I
            was tired and there was nothing to do, so I lay and thought about her. I was thinking
            about her when Rinaldi came in. He looked just the same. Perhaps he was a little
            thinner.</p>
        <p>“Well, baby,” he said. I sat up on the bed. He came over, sat down and put his arm around
            me. “Good old baby.” He whacked me on the back and I held both his arms.</p>
        <p>“Old baby,” he said. “Let me see your knee.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll have to take off my pants.”</p>
        <p>“Take off your pants, baby. We’re all friends here. I want to see what kind of a job they
            did.” I stood up, took off the breeches and pulled off the knee-brace. Rinaldi sat on
            the floor and bent the knee gently back and forth. He ran his finger along the scar; put
            his thumbs together over the kneecap and rocked the knee gently with his fingers.</p>
        <p>“Is that all the articulation you have?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“It’s a crime to send you back. They ought to get complete articulation.”</p>
            
            <pb n="177"/>
            
        <p>“It’s a lot better than it was. It was stiff as a board.”</p>
        <p>Rinaldi bent it more. I watched his hands. He had fine surgeon’s hands. I looked at the
            top of his head, his hair shiny and parted smoothly. He bent the knee too far.</p>
        <p>“Ouch!” I said.</p>
        <p>“You ought to have more treatment on it with the machines,” Rinaldi said.</p>
        <p>“It’s better than it was.”</p>
        <p>“I see that, baby. This is something I know more about than you.” He stood up and sat
            down on the bed. “The knee itself is a good job.” He was through with the knee. “Tell me
            all about everything.”</p>
        <p>“There’s nothing to tell,” I said. “I’ve led a quiet life.”</p>
        <p>“You act like a married man,” he said. “What’s the matter with you?”</p>
        <p>“Nothing,” I said. “What’s the matter with you?”</p>
        <p>“This war is killing me,” Rinaldi said, “I am very depressed by it.” He folded his hands
            over his knee.</p>
        <p>“Oh,” I said.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter? Can’t I even have human impulses ?”</p>
        <p>“No. I can see you’ve been having a fine time. Tell me.”</p>
        <p>“All summer and all fall I’ve operated. I work all the time. I do everybody’s work. All
            the hard ones they leave to me. By God, baby, I am becoming a lovely surgeon.”</p>
        <p>“That sounds better.”</p>
        <p>“I never think. No, by God, I don’t think; I operate.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right.”</p>
            
            <pb n="178"/>
            
        <p>“But now, baby, it’s all over. I don’t operate now and I feel like hell. This is a
            terrible war, baby. You believe me when I say it. Now you cheer me up. Did you bring the
            phonograph records?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>They were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in my rucksack. I was too tired to get them
            out.</p>
        <p>“Don’t you feel good yourself, baby?”</p>
        <p>“I feel like hell.”</p>
        <p>“This war is terrible,” Rinaldi said. “Come on. We’ll both get drunk and be cheerful.
            Then we’ll go get the ashes dragged. Then we’ll feel fine.”</p>
        <p>“I’ve had the jaundice,” I said, “and I can’t get drunk.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, baby, how you’ve come back to me. You come back serious and with a liver. I tell you
            this war is a bad thing. Why did we make it anyway ?”</p>
        <p>“We’ll have a drink. I don’t want to get drunk but we’ll have a drink.”</p>
        <p>Rinaldi went across the room to the washstand and brought back two glasses and a bottle
            of cognac.</p>
        <p>“It’s Austrian cognac,” he said. “Seven stars. It’s all they captured on San
            Gabriele.”</p>
        <p>“Were you up there?”</p>
        <p>“No. I haven’t been anywhere. I’ve been here all the time operating. Look, baby, this is
            your old toothbrushing glass. I kept it all the time to remind me of you.”</p>
        <p>“To remind you to brush your teeth.”</p>
        <p>“No. I have my own too. I kept this to remind me of you trying to brush away the Villa
            Rossa from your teeth in the morning, swearing and eating aspirin and cursing harlots.
            Every time I see that glass I think of you trying to clean your conscience with a
            
            <pb n="179"/>
            
            toothbrush.” He came over to the bed. “Kiss me once and tell me you’re not serious.”</p>
        <p>“I never kiss you. You’re an ape.”</p>
        <p>“I know, you are the fine good Anglo-Saxon boy. I know. You are the remorse boy, I know.
            I will wait till I see the Anglo-Saxon brushing away harlotry with a toothbrush.”</p>
        <p>“Put some cognac in the glass.”</p>
        <p>We touched glasses and drank. Rinaldi laughed at me.</p>
        <p>“I will get you drunk and take out your liver and put you in a good Italian liver and
            make you a man again.”</p>
        <p>I held the glass for some more cognac. It was dark outside now. Holding the glass of
            cognac, I went over and opened the window. The rain had stopped falling. It was colder
            outside and there was a mist in the trees.</p>
        <p>“Don’t throw the cognac out the window,” Rinaldi said. “If you can’t drink it give it to
            me.”</p>
        <p>“Go something yourself,” I said. I was glad to see Rinaldi again. He had spent two years
            teasing me and I had always liked it. We understood each other very well.</p>
        <p>“Are you married?” he asked from the bed. I was standing against the wall by the
            window.</p>
        <p>“Not yet.”</p>
        <p>“Are you in love ?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“With that English girl?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Poor baby. Is she good to you?”</p>
        <p>“Of course.”</p>
        <p>“I mean is she good to you practically speaking?”</p>
        <p>“Shut up.”</p>
            
            <pb n="180"/>
            
        <p>“I will. You will see I am a man of extreme delicacy. Does she----?”</p>
        <p>“Rinin,” I said. “Please shut up. If you want to be my friend, shut up.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t <hi>want</hi> to be your friend, baby. I <hi>am</hi>
            your friend.”</p>
        <p>“Then shut up.”</p>
        <p>“All right.”</p>
        <p>I went over to the bed and sat down beside Rinaldi. He was holding his glass and looking
            at the floor.</p>
        <p>“You see how it is, Rinin?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes. All my life I encounter sacred subjects. But very few with you. I suppose you
            must have them too.” He looked at the floor.</p>
        <p>“You haven’t any?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“Not any?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“I can say this about your mother and that about your sister?”</p>
        <p>“And that about <hi>your sister,”</hi> Rinaldi said swiftly. We both
            laughed.</p>
        <p>“The old superman,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I am jealous maybe,” Rinaldi said.</p>
        <p>“No, you’re not.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t mean like that. I mean something else. Have you any married friends?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I haven’t,” Rinaldi said. “Not if they love each other.”</p>
        <p>“Why not?”</p>
        <p>“They don’t like me.”</p>
        <p>“Why not?”</p>
            
            <pb n="181"/>
            
        <p>“I am the snake. I am the snake of reason.”</p>
        <p>“You’re getting it mixed. The apple was reason.”</p>
        <p>“No, it was the snake.” He was more
            cheerful.</p>
        <p>“You are better when you don’t think so deeply,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I love you, baby,” he said. “You puncture me when I become a great Italian thinker. But
            I know many things I can’t say. I know more than you.”</p>
        <p>“Yes. You do.”</p>
        <p>“But you will have a better time. Even with remorse you will have a better time.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes. That is true. Already I am only happy when I am working.” He looked at the
            floor again.</p>
        <p>“You’ll get over that.”</p>
        <p>“No. I only like two other things; one is bad for my work and the other is over in half
            an hour or fifteen minutes. Sometimes less.”</p>
        <p>“Sometimes a good deal less.”</p>
        <p>“Perhaps I have improved, baby. You do not know. But there are only the two things and my
            work.”</p>
        <p>“You’ll get other things.”</p>
        <p>“No. We never get anything. We are born with all we have and we never learn. We never get
            anything new. We all start complete. You should be glad not to be a Latin.”</p>
        <p>“There’s no such thing as a Latin. That is ‘Latin’ thinking. You are so proud of your
            defects.” Rinaldi looked up and laughed.</p>
        <p>“We’ll stop, baby. I am tired from thinking so much.” He had looked tired when he came
            in. “It’s nearly time to eat. I’m glad you’re back. You are my best friend and my war
            brother.”</p>
        <p>“When do the war brothers eat?” I asked.</p>
            
            <pb n="182"/>
            
        <p>“Right away. We’ll drink once more for your liver’s sake.”</p>
        <p>“Like Saint Paul.”</p>
        <p>“You are inaccurate. That was wine and the stomach. Take a little wine for your stomach’s
            sake.”</p>
        <p>“Whatever you have in the bottle,” I said. “For any sake you mention.”</p>
        <p>“To your girl,” Rinaldi said. He held out his glass.</p>
        <p>“All right.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll never say a dirty thing about her.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t strain yourself.”</p>
        <p>He drank off the cognac. “I am pure,” he said. “I am like you, baby. I will get an
            English girl too. As a matter of fact I knew your girl first but she was a little tall
            for me. A tall girl for a sister,” he quoted.</p>
        <p>“You have a lovely pure mind,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Haven’t I ? That’s why they call me Rinaldo Purissimo.”</p>
        <p>“Rinaldo Sporchissimo.”</p>
        <p>“Come on, baby, we’ll go down to eat while my mind is still pure.”</p>
        <p>I washed, combed my hair and we went down the stairs. Rinaldi was a little drunk. In the
            room where we ate, the meal was not quite ready.</p>
        <p>“I’ll go get the bottle,” Rinaldi said. He went off up the stairs. I sat at the table and
            he came back with the bottle and poured us each a half tumbler of cognac.</p>
        <p>“Too much,” I said and held up the glass and sighted at the lamp on the table.</p>
        <p>“Not for an empty stomach. It is a wonderful thing. It burns out the stomach completely.
            Nothing is worse for you.”</p>
        <p>“All right.”</p>
            
            <pb n="183"/>
            
        <p>“Self-destruction day by day,” Rinaldi said. “It ruins the stomach and makes the hand
            shake. Just the thing for a surgeon.”</p>
        <p>“You recommend it?”</p>
        <p>“Heartily. I use no other. Drink it down, baby, and look forward to being sick.”</p>
        <p>I drank half the glass. In the hall I could hear the orderly calling. “Soup! Soup is
            ready!”</p>
        <p>The major came in, nodded to us and sat down. He seemed very small at table.</p>
        <p>“Is this all we are?” he asked. The orderly put the soup bowl down and he ladled out a
            plate full.</p>
        <p>“We are all,” Rinaldi said. “Unless the priest comes. If he knew Federico was here he
            would be here.”</p>
        <p>“Where is he?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“He’s at 307,” the major said. He was busy with his soup. He wiped his mouth, wiping his
            upturned gray mustache carefully. “He will come I think. I called them and left word to
            tell him you were here.”</p>
        <p>“I miss the noise of the mess,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, it’s quiet,” the major said.</p>
        <p>“I will be noisy,” said Rinaldi.</p>
        <p>“Drink some wine, Enrico,” said the major. He filled my glass. The spaghetti came in and
            we were all busy. We were finishing the spaghetti when the priest came in. He was the
            same as ever, small and brown and compact looking. I stood up and we shook hands. He put
            his hand on my shoulder.</p>
        <p>“I came as soon as I heard,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Sit down,” the major said. “You’re late.”</p>
        <p>“Good-evening, priest,” Rinaldi said, using the English word. They had taken that up from
            the priest-baiting captain, who spoke a little English. “Good-evening,
            
            <pb n="184"/>
            
            Rinaldo,” the priest said. The orderly brought him soup but he said he would start with
            the spaghetti.</p>
        <p>“How are you?” he asked me.</p>
        <p>“Fine,” I said. “How have things been?”</p>
        <p>“Drink some wine, priest,” Rinaldi said. “Take a little wine for your stomach’s sake.
            That’s Saint Paul, you know.”</p>
        <p>“Yes I know,” said the priest politely. Rinaldi filled his glass.</p>
        <p>“That Saint Paul,” said Rinaldi. “He’s the one who makes all the trouble.” The priest
            looked at me and smiled. I could see that the baiting did not touch him now.</p>
        <p>“That Saint Paul,” Rinaldi said. “He was a rounder and a chaser and then when he was no
            longer hot he said it was no good. When he was finished he made the rules for us who are
            still hot. Isn’t it true, Federico ?”</p>
        <p>The major smiled. We were eating meat stew now.</p>
        <p>“I never discuss a Saint after dark,” I said. The priest looked up from the stew and
            smiled at me.</p>
        <p>“There he is, gone over with the priest,” Rinaldi said. “Where are all the good old
            priest-baiters? Where is Cavalcanti? Where is Brundi? Where is Cesare? Do I have to bait
            this priest alone without support?”</p>
        <p>“He is a good priest,” said the major.</p>
        <p>“He is a good priest,” said Rinaldi. “But still a priest. I try to make the mess like the
            old days. I want to make Federico happy. To hell with you, priest!”</p>
        <p>I saw the major look at him and notice that he was drunk. His thin face was white. The
            line of his hair was very black against the white of his forehead.</p>
            
            <pb n="185"/>
            
        <p>“It’s all right, Rinaldo,” said the priest. “It’s all right.”</p>
        <p>“To hell with you,” said Rinaldi. “To hell with the whole damn business.” He sat back in
            his chair.</p>
        <p>“He’s been under a strain and he’s tired,” the major said to me. He finished his meat and
            wiped up the gravy with a piece of bread.</p>
        <p>“I don’t give a damn,” Rinaldi said to the table. “To hell with the whole business.” He
            looked defiantly around the table, his eyes flat, his face pale.</p>
        <p>“All right,” I said. “To hell with the whole damn business.”</p>
        <p>“No, no,” said Rinaldi. “You can’t do it. You can’t do it. I say you can’t do it. You’re
            dry and you’re empty and there’s nothing else. There’s nothing else I tell you. Not a
            damned thing. I know, when I stop working.”</p>
        <p>The priest shook his head. The orderly took away the stew dish.</p>
        <p>“What are you eating meat for?” Rinaldi turned to the priest. “Don’ you know it’s
            Friday?”</p>
        <p>“It’s Thursday,” the priest said.</p>
        <p>“It’s a lie. It’s Friday. You’re eating the body of our Lord. It’s God-meat. I know. It’s
            dead Austrian. That’s what you’re eating.”</p>
        <p>“The white meat is from officers,” I said, completing the old joke.</p>
        <p>Rinaldi laughed. He filled his glass.</p>
        <p>“Don’t mind me,” he said. “I’m just a little crazy.”</p> 
        <p>“You ought to have a leave,” the
            priest said.</p>
        <p>The major shook his head at him. Rinaldi looked at the priest.</p>
        <p>“You think I ought to have a leave?”</p>
            
            <pb n="186"/>
            
        <p>The major shook his head at the priest. Rinaldi was looking at the priest.</p>
        <p>“Just as you like,” the priest said. “Not if you don’t want.”</p>
        <p>“To hell with you,” Rinaldi said. “They try to get rid of me. Every night they try to get
            rid of me. I fight them off. What if I have it. Everybody has it. The whole world’s got
            it. First,” he went on, assuming the manner of a lecturer, “it’s a little pimple. Then
            we notice a rash between the shoulders. Then we notice nothing at all. We put our faith
            in mercury.”</p>
        <p>“Or salvarsan,” the major interrupted quietly.</p>
        <p>“A mercurial product,” Rinaldi said. He acted very elated now. “I know something worth
            two of that. Good old priest,” he said. “You’ll never get it. Baby will get it. It’s an
            industrial accident. It’s a simple industrial accident.”</p>
        <p>The orderly brought in the sweet and coffee. The dessert was a sort of black bread
            pudding with hard sauce. The lamp was smoking; the black smoke going close up inside the
            chimney.</p>
        <p>“Bring two candles and take away the lamp,” the major said. The orderly brought two
            lighted candles each in a saucer, and took out the lamp blowing it out. Rinaldi was
            quiet now. He seemed all right. We talked and after the coffee we all went out into the
            hall.</p>
        <p>“You want to talk to the priest. I have to go in the town,” Rinaldi said. “Good-night,
            priest.”</p>
        <p>“Good-night, Rinaldo,” the priest said.</p>
        <p>“I’ll see you Fredi,” Rinaldi said.</p>
        <p>Yes,” I said. “Come in early.” He made a face and went out the door. The major was
            standing with us. “He’s very tired and overworked,” he said. “He thinks too he has
            syphilis. I don’t believe it but he may have.
            
            <pb n="187"/>
            
            He is treating himself for it. Good-night. You will leave before daylight, Enrico?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Good-by then,” he said. “Good luck. Peduzzi will wake you and go with you.”</p>
        <p>“Good-by, Signor Maggiore.”</p>
        <p>“Good-by. They talk about an Austrian offensive but I don’t believe it. I hope not But
            anyway it won’t be here. Gino will tell you everything. The telephone works well
            now.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll call regularly.”</p>
        <p>“Please do. Good-night. Don’t let Rinaldi drink so much brandy.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll try not to.”</p>
        <p>“Good-night, priest.”</p>
        <p>“Good-night, Signor Maggiore.”</p>
        <p>He went off into his office.</p>

        <p>I went to the door and looked out. It had stopped raining but there was a mist.</p>
        <p>“Should we go upstairs?” I asked the priest.</p>
        <p>“I can only stay a little while.”</p>
        <p>“Come on up.”</p>
        <p>We climbed the stairs and went into my room. I lay down on Rinaldi’s bed. The priest sat
            on my cot that the orderly had set up. It was dark in the room.</p>
        <p>“Well,” he said, “how are you really?”</p>
        <p>“I'm all right. I'm tired to-night.”</p>
        <p>“I’m tired too, but from no cause.”</p>
        <p>“What about the war ?”</p>
        <p>“I think it will be over soon. I don’t know why, but I feel it.”</p>
        <p>“How do you feel it?”</p>
        <p>“You know how your major is? Gentle? Many people are like that now.”</p>
        <p>“I feel that way myself,” I said.</p>
        <p>“It has been a terrible summer,” said the priest. He was surer of himself now than when I
            had gone away. “You cannot believe how it has been. Except that you have been there and
            you know how it can be. Many people have realized the war this summer. Officers whom I
            thought could never realize it realize it now.”</p>
        <p>“What will happen ?” I stroked the blanket with my hand.</p>
        <p>“I do not know but I do not think it can go on much longer.”</p>
        <p>“What will happen?”</p>
        <p>“They will stop fighting.”</p>
            
            <pb n="189"/>
            
        <p>“Who?”</p>
        <p>“Both sides.”</p>
        <p>“I hope so,” I said.</p>
        <p>“You don’t believe it?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe both sides will stop fighting at once.”</p>
        <p>“I suppose not. It is too much to expect. But when I see the changes in men I do not
            think it can go on.”</p>
        <p>“Who won the fighting this summer?”</p>
        <p>“No one.”</p>
        <p>“The Austrians won,” I said. “They kept them from taking San Gabriele. They’ve won. They
            won’t stop fighting.”</p>
        <p>“If they feel as we feel they may stop. They have gone through the same thing.”</p>
        <p>“No one ever stopped when they were winning.”</p>
        <p>“You discourage me.”</p>
        <p>“I can only say what I think.”</p>
        <p>“Then you think it will go on and on? Nothing will ever happen ?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. I only think the Austrians will not stop when they have won a victory. It
            is in defeat that we become Christian.”</p>
        <p>“The Austrians are Christians—-except for the Bosnians.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t mean technically Christian. I mean like Our Lord.”</p>
        <p>He said nothing.</p>
        <p>“We are all gentler now because we are beaten. How would Our Lord have been if Peter had
            rescued him in the Garden ?”</p>
        <p>“He would have been just the same.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so,” I said.</p>
        <p>“You discourage me,” he said. “I believe and I pray that something will happen. I have
            felt it very close.”</p>
            
            <pb n="190"/>
            
        <p>“Something may happen,” I said. “But it will happen only to us. If they felt the way we
            do, it would be all right. But they have beaten us. They feel another way.”</p>
        <p>“Many of the soldiers have always felt this way. It is not because they were beaten.”</p>
        <p>“They were beaten to start with. They were beaten when they took them from their farms
            and put them in the army. That is why the peasant has wisdom, because he is defeated
            from the start. Put him in power and see how wise he is.”</p>
        <p>He did not say anything. He was thinking.</p>
        <p>“Now I am depressed myself,” I said. “That’s why I never think about these things. I
            never think and yet when I begin to talk I say the things I have found out in my mind
            without thinking.”</p>
        <p>“I had hoped for something.”</p>
        <p>“Defeat?”</p>
        <p>“No. Something more.”</p>
        <p>“There isn’t anything more. Except victory. It may be worse.”</p>
        <p>“I hoped for a long time for victory.”</p>
        <p>“Me too.”</p>
        <p>“Now I don’t know.”</p>
        <p>“It has to be one or the other.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe in victory any more.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t. But I don’t believe in defeat. Though it may be better.”</p>
        <p>“What do you believe in?”</p>
        <p>“In sleep,” I said. He stood up.</p>
        <p>“I am very sorry to have stayed so long. But I like so to talk with you.”</p>
        <p>“It is very nice to talk again. I said that about sleeping, meaning nothing.”</p>
            
            <pb n="191"/>
            
        <p>We stood up and shook hands in the dark.</p>
        <p>“I sleep at 307 now,” he said.</p>
        <p>“I go out on post early to-morrow.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll see you when you come back.”</p>
        <p>“We’ll have a walk and talk together.” I walked with him to the door.</p>
        <p>“Don’t go down,” he said. “It is very nice that you are back. Though not so nice for
            you.” He put his hand on my shoulder.</p>
        <p>“It’s all right for me,” I said. “Good-night.”</p>
        <p>“Good-night. Ciaou!”</p>
        <p>“Ciaou!” I said. I was deadly sleepy.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXVII</head>
        <p>I woke when Rinaldi came in but he did not talk and I went back to sleep again. In the
            morning I was dressed and gone before it was light. Rinaldi did not wake when I
            left.</p>
        <p>I had not seen the Bainsizza before and it was strange to go up the slope where the
            Austrians had been, beyond the place on the river where I had been wounded. There was a
            steep new road and many trucks. Beyond, the road flattened out and I saw woods and steep
            hills in the mist. There were woods that had been taken quickly and not smashed. Then
            beyond where the road was not protected by the hills it was screened by matting on the
            sides and over the top. The road ended in a wrecked village. The lines were up beyond.
            There was much artillery around. The houses were badly smashed but things were very well
            organized and there were signboards everywhere. We found Gino and he got us some coffee
            and later I went with him and met various people and saw the posts. Gino said the
            British cars were working further down the Bainsizza at Ravne. He had great admiration
            for the British. There was still a certain amount of shelling, he said, but not many
            wounded. There would be many sick now the rains had started. The Austrians were supposed
            to attack but he did not believe it. We were supposed to attack too, but they had not
            brought up any new troops so he thought that was off too. Food was scarce and he would
            be glad to get a full meal in Gorizia. What kind of supper had I had? I told him and he
            said that
            
            <pb n="193"/>
            
            would be wonderful. He was especially impressed by the <hi>dolce</hi>. I did not describe it in
            detail, only said it was a <hi>dolce</hi>, and I think he believed it was something more
            elaborate than bread pudding.</p>
        <p>Did I know where he was going to go? I said I didn’t but that some of the other cars were
            at Caporetto. He hoped he would go up that way. It was a nice little place and he liked
            the high mountain hauling up beyond. He was a nice boy and every one seemed to like him.
            He said where it really had been hell was at San Gabriele and the attack beyond Lom that
            had gone bad. He said the Austrians had a great amount of artillery in the woods along
            Ternova ridge beyond and above us, and shelled the roads badly at night. There was a
            battery of naval guns that had gotten on his nerves. I would recognize them because of
            their flat trajectory. You heard the report and then the shriek commenced almost
            instantly. They usually fired two guns at once, one right after the other, and the
            fragments from the burst were enormous. He showed me one, a smoothly jagged piece of
            metal over a foot long. It looked like babbiting metal.</p>
        <p>“I don’t suppose they are so effective,” Gino said. “But they scare me. They all sound as
            though they came directly for you. There is the boom, then instantly the shriek and
            burst. What’s the use of not being wounded if they scare you to death?”</p>
        <p>He said there were Croats in the lines opposite us now and some Magyars. Our troops were
            still in the attacking positions. There was no wire to speak of and no place to fall
            back to if there should be an Austrian attack. There were fine positions for defense
            along the low mountains that came up out of the plateau but nothing had been done about
            organizing them for defense.
            
            <pb n="194"/>
            
        What did I think about the Bainsizza anyway?</p>
        <p>I had expected it to be flatter, more like a plateau. I had not realized it was so broken
            up.</p>
        <p>“Alto piano,” Gino said, “but no piano.”</p>
        <p>We went back to the cellar of the house where he lived. I said I thought a ridge that
            flattened out on top and had a little depth would be easier and more practical to hold
            than a succession of small mountains. It was no harder to attack up a mountain than on
            the level, I argued. “That depends on the mountains,” he said. “Look at San
            Gabriele.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “but where they had trouble was at the top where it was flat. They got up
            to the top easy enough.”</p>
        <p>“Not so easy,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “but that was a special case because it was a fortress rather than a
            mountain, anyway. The Austrians had been fortifying it for years.” I meant tactically
            speaking in a war where there was some movement a succession of mountains were nothing
            to hold as a line because it was too easy to turn them. You should have possible
            mobility and a mountain is not very mobile. Also, people always over-shoot down hill. If
            the flank were turned, the best men would be left on the highest mountains. I did not
            believe in a war in mountains. I had thought about it a lot, I said. You pinched off one
            mountain and they pinched off another but when something really started every one had to
            get down off the mountains.</p>
        <p>What were you going to do if you had a mountain frontier? he asked.</p>
        <p>I had not worked that out yet, I said, and we both laughed. “But,” I said, “in the old
            days the Austrians were always whipped in the quadrilateral around Verona.
            
            <pb n="195"/>
            
         They let them come down onto the plain and whipped them there.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said Gino. “But those were Frenchmen and you can work out military problems
            clearly when you are fighting in somebody else’s country.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I agreed, “when it is your own country you cannot use it so scientifically.”</p>
        <p>“The Russians did, to trap Napoleon.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, but they had plenty of country. If you tried to retreat to trap Napoleon in Italy
            you would find yourself in Brindisi.”</p>
        <p>“A terrible place,” said Gino. “Have you ever been there?”</p>
        <p>“Not to stay.”</p>
        <p>“I am a patriot,” Gino said. “But I cannot love Brindisi or Taranto.”</p>
        <p>“Do you love the Bainsizza?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“The soil is sacred,” he said. “But I wish it grew more potatoes. You know when we came
            here we found fields of potatoes the Austrians had planted.”</p>
        <p>“Has the food really been short ?”</p>
        <p>“I myself have never had enough to eat but I am a big eater and I have not starved. The
            mess is average. The regiments in the line get pretty good food but those in support
            don’t get so much. Something is wrong somewhere. There should be plenty of food.”</p>
        <p>“The dogfish are selling it somewhere else.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, they give the battalions in the front line as much as they can but the ones in back
            are very short. They have eaten all the Austrians’ potatoes and chestnuts from the
            woods. They ought to feed them better. We are big eaters. I am sure there is plenty of
            food. It is very bad for the soldiers to be short of food.
            
            <pb n="196"/>
            
            Have you ever noticed the difference it makes in the way you think ?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said. “It can’t win a war but it can lose one.”</p>
        <p>“We won’t talk about losing. There is enough talk about losing. What has been done this
            summer cannot have been done in vain.”</p>
        <p>I did not say anything. I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and
            sacrifice and the expression in vain. We had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain
            almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them,
            on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a
            long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory
            and the sacrifices were like the stock-yards at Chicago if nothing was done with the
            meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and
            finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and
            certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have
            them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene
            beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the
            numbers of regiments and the dates. Gino was a patriot, so he said things that separated
            us sometimes, but he was also a fine boy and I understood his being a patriot. He was
            born one. He left with Peduzzi in the car to go back to Gorizia.</p>
        <p>It stormed all that day. The wind drove down the rain and everywhere there was standing
            water and mud. The plaster of the broken houses was gray and wet. Late in the afternoon
            the rain stopped and from
            
            <pb n="197"/>
            
            out number two post I saw the bare wet autumn country with clouds over the tops of the
            hills and the straw screening over the roads wet and dripping. The sun came out once
            before it went down and shone on the bare woods beyond the ridge. There were many
            Austrian guns in the woods on that ridge but only a few fired. I watched the sudden
            round puffs of shrapnel smoke in the sky above a broken farmhouse near where the line
            was; soft puffs with a yellow white flash in the centre. You saw the flash, then heard
            the crack, then saw the smoke ball distort and thin in the wind. There were many iron
            shrapnel balls in the rubble of the houses and on the road beside the broken house where
            the post was, but they did not shell near the post that afternoon. We loaded two cars
            and drove down the road that was screened with wet mats and the last of the sun came
            through in the breaks between the strips of mattings. Before we were out on the clear
            road behind the hill the sun was down. We went on down the clear road and as it turned a
            corner into the open and went into the square arched tunnel of matting the rain started
            again.</p>
        <p>The wind rose in the night and at three o’clock in the morning with the rain coming in
            sheets there was a bombardment and the Croatians came over across the mountain meadows
            and through patches of woods and into the front line. They fought in the dark in the
            rain and a counter-attack of scared men from the second line drove them back. There was
            much shelling and many rockets in the rain and machine-gun and rifle fire all along the
            line. They did not come again and it was quieter and between the gusts of wind and rain
            we could hear the sound of a great bombardment far to the north.</p>
            
            <pb n="198"/>
            
        <p>The wounded were coming into the post, some were carried on stretchers, some walking and
            some were brought on the backs of men that came across the field. They were wet to the
            skin and all were scared. We filled two cars with stretcher cases as they came up from
            the cellar of the post and as I shut the door of the second car and fastened it I felt
            the rain on my face turn to snow. The flakes were coming heavy and fast in the rain.</p>
        <p>When daylight came the storm was still blowing but the snow had stopped. It had melted as
            it fell on the wet ground and now it was raining again. There was another attack just
            after daylight but it was unsuccessful. We expected an attack all day but it did not
            come until the sun was going down. The bombardment started to the south below the long
            wooded ridge where the Austrian guns were concentrated. We expected a bombardment but it
            did not come. It was getting dark. Guns were firing from the field behind the village
            and the shells, going away, had a comfortable sound.</p>
        <p>We heard that the attack to the south had been unsuccessful. They did not attack that
            night but we heard that they had broken through to the north. In the night word came
            that we were to prepare to retreat. The captain at the post told me this. He had it from
            the Brigade. A little while later he came from the telephone and said it was a lie. The
            Brigade had received orders that the line of the Bainsizza should be held no matter what
            happened. I asked about the break through and he said that he had heard at the Brigade
            that the Austrians had broken through the twenty-seventh army corps up toward Caporetto.
            There had been a great battle in the north all day.</p>
        <p>“If those bastards let them through we are cooked,” he said.</p>
            
            <pb n="199"/>
            
        <p>“It’s Germans that are attacking,” one of the medical officers said. The word Germans was
            something to be frightened of. We did not want to have anything to do with the
            Germans.</p>
        <p>“There are fifteen divisions of Germans,” the medical officer said. “They have broken
            through and we will be cut off.”</p>
        <p>“At the Brigade, they say this line is to be held. They say they have not broken through
            badly and that we will hold a line across the mountains from Monte Maggiore.”</p>
        <p>“Where do they hear this?”</p>
        <p>“From the Division.”</p>
        <p>“The word that we were to retreat came from the Division.”</p>
        <p>“We work under the Army Corps,” I said. “But here I work under you. Naturally when you
            tell me to go I will go. But get the orders straight.”</p>
        <p>“The orders are that we stay here. You clear the wounded from here to the clearing
            station.”</p>
        <p>“Sometimes we clear from the clearing station to the field hospitals too,” I said. “Tell
            me, I have never seen a retreat—if there is a retreat how are all the wounded
            evacuated?”</p>
        <p>“They are not. They take as many as they can and leave the rest.”</p>
        <p>“What will I take in the cars ?”</p>
        <p>“Hospital equipment.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” I said.</p>
        <p>The next night the retreat started. We heard that Germans and Austrians had broken
            through in the north and were coming down the mountain valleys toward Cividale and
            Udine. The retreat was orderly, wet and sullen. In the night, going slowly along the
            crowded roads we passed troops marching under the
            
            <pb n="200"/>
            
            rain, guns, horses pulling wagons, mules, motor trucks, all moving away from the front.
            There was no more disorder than in an advance.</p>
        <p>That night we helped empty the field hospitals that had been set up in the least ruined
            villages of the plateau, taking the wounded down to Plava on the riverbed: and the next
            day hauled all day in the rain to evacuate the hospitals and clearing station at Plava.
            It rained steadily and the army of the Bainsizza moved down off the plateau in the
            October rain and across the river where the great victories had commenced in the spring
            of that year. We came into Gorizia in the middle of the next day. The rain had stopped
            and the town was nearly empty. As we came up the street they were loading the girls from
            the soldiers’ whorehouse into a truck. There were seven girls and they had on their hats
            and coats and carried small suitcases. Two of them were crying. Of the others one smiled
            at us and put out her tongue and fluttered it up and down. She had thick full lips and
            black eyes.</p>
        <p>I stopped the car and went over and spoke to the matron. The girls from the officers’
            house had left early that morning, she said. Where were they going? To Conegliano, she
            said. The truck started. The girl with thick lips put out her tongue again at us. The
            matron waved. The two girls kept on crying. The others looked interestedly out at the
            town. I got back in the car.</p>
        <p>“We ought to go with them,” Bonello said. “That would be a good trip.”</p>
        <p>“We’ll have a good trip,” I said.</p>
        <p>“We’ll have a hell of a trip.”</p>
        <p>“That’s what I mean,” I said. We came up the drive to the villa.</p>
            
            <pb n="201"/>
            
        <p>“I’d like to be there when some of those tough babies climb in and try and hop them.”</p>
        <p>“You think they will?”</p>
        <p>“Sure. Everybody in the Second Army knows that matron.”</p>
        <p>We were outside the villa.</p>
        <p>“They call her the Mother Superior,” Bonello said. “The girls are new but everybody knows
            her. They must have brought them up just before the retreat.”</p>
        <p>“They’ll have a time.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll say they’ll have a time. I’d like to have a crack at them for nothing. They charge
            too much at that house anyway. The government gyps us.”</p>
        <p>“Take the car out and have the mechanics go over it,” I said. “Change the oil and check
            the differential. Fill it up and then get some sleep.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, Signor Tenente.”</p>
        <p>The villa was empty. Rinaldi was gone with the hospital. The major was gone taking
            hospital personnel in the staff car. There was a note on the window for me to fill the
            cars with the material piled in the hall and to proceed to Pordenone. The mechanics were
            gone already. I went out back to the garage. The other two cars came in while I was
            there and their drivers got down. It was starting to rain again.</p>
        <p>“I’m so-----sleepy I went to sleep three times coming here from Plava,” Piani said. “What
            are we going to do, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“We’ll change the oil, grease them, fill them up, then take them around in front and load
            up the junk they’ve left.”</p>
        <p>“Then do we start ?”</p>
        <p>“No, we’ll sleep for three hours.”</p>
            
            <pb n="202"/>
            
        <p>“Christ I’m glad to sleep,” Bonello said. “I couldn’t keep awake driving.”</p>
        <p>“How’s your car, Aymo ?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“It’s all right.”</p>
        <p>“Get me a monkey suit and I’ll help you with the oil.”</p>
        <p>“Don’t you do that, Tenente,” Aymo said. “It’s nothing to do. You go and pack your
            things.”</p>
        <p>“My things are all packed,” I said. “I’ll go and carry out the stuff that they left for
            us. Bring the cars around as soon as they’re ready.”</p>
        <p>They brought the cars around to the front of the villa and we loaded them with the
            hospital equipment which was piled in the hallway. When it was all in, the three cars
            stood in line down the driveway under the trees in the rain. We went inside.</p>
        <p>“Make a fire in the kitchen and dry your things,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I don’t care about dry clothes,” Piani said. “I want to sleep.”</p>
        <p>“I’m going to sleep on the major’s bed,” Bonello said. “I’m going to sleep where the old
            man corks off.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care where I sleep,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“There are two beds in here.” I opened the door.</p>
        <p>“I never knew what was in that room,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“That was old fish-face’s room,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“You two sleep in there,” I said. “I’ll wake you.”</p>
        <p>“The Austrians will wake us if you sleep too long, Tenente,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“I won’t oversleep,” I said. “Where’s Aymo?”</p> 
        <p>“He went out in the kitchen.”</p>
        <p>“Get to sleep,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I’ll sleep,” Piani said. “I’ve been asleep sitting up
            
            <pb n="203"/>
            
            all day. The whole top of my head kept coming down over my eyes.”</p>
        <p>“Take your boots off,” Bonello said. “That’s old fish-face’s bed.”</p>
        <p>“Fish-face is nothing to me.” Piani lay on the bed, his muddy boots straight out, his
            head on his arm. I went out to the kitchen. Aymo had a fire in the stove and a kettle of
            water on.</p>
        <p>“I thought I'd start some <hi>pasta asciutta,”</hi> he said. “We’ll be hungry
            when we wake up.”</p>
        <p>“Aren’t you sleepy, Bartolomeo?”</p>
        <p>“Not so sleepy. When the water boils I’ll leave it. The fire will go down.”</p>
        <p>“You’d better get some sleep,” I said. “We can eat cheese and monkey meat.”</p>
        <p>“This is better,” he said. “Something hot will be good for those two anarchists. You go
            to sleep, Tenente.”</p>
        <p>“There’s a bed in the major’s room.”</p>
        <p>“You sleep there.”</p>
        <p>“No, I’m going up to my old room. Do you want a drink, Bartolomeo ?”</p>
        <p>“When we go, Tenente. Now it wouldn’t do me any good.”</p>
        <p>“If you wake in three hours and I haven’t called you, wake me, will you?”</p>
        <p>“I haven’t any watch, Tenente.”</p>
        <p>“There’s a clock on the wall in the major’s room.”</p>
        <p>“All right.”</p>
        <p>I went out then through the dining-room and the hall and up the marble stairs to the room
            where I had lived with Rinaldi. It was raining outside. I went to the window and looked
            out. It was getting dark and I saw the three cars standing in line under the trees.
            
            <pb n="204"/>
            
            The trees were dripping in the rain. It was cold and the drops hung to the branches. I
            went back to Rinaldi’s bed and lay down and let sleep take me.</p>
        <p>We ate in the kitchen before we started. Aymo had a basin of spaghetti with onions and
            tinned meat chopped up in it We sat around the table and drank two bottles of the wine
            that had been left in the cellar of the villa. It was dark outside and still raining.
            Piani sat at the table very sleepy.</p>
        <p>“I like a retreat better than an advance,” Bonello said. “On a retreat we drink
            barbera.”</p>
        <p>“We drink it now. To-morrow maybe we drink rainwater,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“To-morrow we’ll be in Udine. We’ll drink champagne. That’s where the slackers live. Wake
            up, Piani! We’ll drink champagne to-morrow in Udine!”</p>
        <p>“I’m awake,” Piani said. He filled his plate with the spaghetti and meat. “Couldn’t you
            find tomato sauce, Barto ?”</p>
        <p>“There wasn’t any,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“We’ll drink champagne in Udine,” Bonello said. He filled his glass with the clear red
            barbera.</p>
        <p>“We may drink----before Udine,” Piani said.</p> 
        <p>“Have you eaten enough, Tenente?” Aymo asked.</p>
        <p>“I’ve got plenty. Give me the bottle, Bartolomeo.”</p> 
        <p>“I have a bottle apiece to take in
            the cars,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“Did you sleep at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t need much sleep. I slept a little.”</p>
        <p>“To-morrow we’ll sleep in the king’s bed,” Bonello said. He was feeling very good.</p>
        <p>“To-morrow maybe we’ll sleep in----,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“I’ll sleep with the queen,” Bonello said. He looked to see how I took the joke.</p>
            
            <pb n="205"/>
            
        <p>“You’ll sleep with----,” Piani said sleepily.</p>
        <p>“That’s treason, Tenente,” Bonello said. “Isn’t that treason?”</p>
        <p>“Shut up,” I said. “You get too funny with a little wine.” Outside it was raining hard. I
            looked at my watch. It was half-past nine.</p>
        <p>“It’s time to roll,” I said and stood up.</p>
        <p>“Who are you going to ride with, Tenente?” Bonello asked.</p>
        <p>“With Aymo. Then you come. Then Piani. We’ll start out on the road for Cormons.”</p>
        <p>“I’m afraid I’ll go to sleep,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“All right. I’ll ride with you. Then Bonello. Then Aymo.”</p>
        <p>“That’s the best way,” Piani said. “Because I’m so sleepy.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll drive and you sleep awhile.”</p>
        <p>“No. I can drive just so long as I know somebody will wake me up if I go to sleep.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll wake you up. Put out the lights, Barto.”</p>
        <p>“You might as well leave them,” Bonello said. “We’ve got no more use for this place.”</p>
        <p>“I have a small locker trunk in my room,” I said. “Will you help take it down,
            Piani?”</p>
        <p>“We’ll take it,” Piani said. “Come on, Aldo.” He went off into the hall with Bonello. I
            heard them going upstairs.</p>
        <p>“This was a fine place,” Bartolomeo Aymo said. He put two bottles of wine and half a
            cheese into his haversack. “There won’t be a place like this again. Where will they
            retreat to, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“Beyond the Tagliamento, they say. The hospital and the sector are to be at
            Pordenone.”</p>
            
            <pb n="206"/>
            
        <p>“This is a better town than Pordenone.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know Pordenone,” I said. “I’ve just been through there.”</p>
        <p>“It’s not much of a place,” Aymo said.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXVIII</head>
        <p>As we moved out through the town it was empty in the rain and the dark except for columns
            of troops and guns that were going through the main street. There were many trucks too
            and some carts going through on other streets and converging on the main road. When we
            were out past the tanneries onto the main road the troops, the motor trucks, the
            horse-drawn carts and the guns were in one wide slow-moving column. We moved slowly but
            steadily in the rain, the radiator cap of our car almost against the tailboard of a
            truck that was loaded high, the load covered with wet canvas. Then the truck stopped.
            The whole column was stopped. It started again and we went a little farther, then
            stopped. I got out and walked ahead, going between the trucks and carts and under the
            wet necks of the horses. The block was farther ahead. I left the road, crossed the ditch
            on a footboard and walked along the field beyond the ditch. I could see the stalled
            column between the trees in the rain as I went forward across from it in the field. I
            went about a mile. The column did not move, although, on the other side beyond the
            stalled vehicles I could see the troops moving. I went back to the cars. This block
            might extend as far as Udine. Piani was asleep over the wheel. I climbed up beside him
            and went to sleep too. Several hours later I heard the truck ahead of us grinding into
            gear. I woke Piani and we started, moving a few yards, then stopping, then going on
            again. It was still raining.</p>
        <p>The column stalled again in the night and did not
            
            <pb n="208"/>
            
            start. I got down and went back to see Aymo and Bonello. Bonello had two sergeants of
            engineers on the seat of his car with him. They stiffened when I came up.</p>
        <p>“They were left to do something to a bridge,” Bonello said. “They can’t find their unit
            so I gave them a ride.”</p>
        <p>“With the Sir Lieutenant’s permission.”</p>
        <p>“With permission,” I said.</p>
        <p>“The lieutenant is an American,” Bonello said. “He’ll give anybody a ride.”</p>
        <p>One of the sergeants smiled. The other asked Bonello if I was an Italian from North or
            South America.</p>
        <p>“He’s not an Italian. He’s North American English.”</p>
        <p>The sergeants were polite but did not believe it. I left them and went back to Aymo. He
            had two girls on the seat with him and was sitting back in the corner and smoking.</p>
        <p>“Barto, Barto,” I said. He laughed.</p>
        <p>“Talk to them, Tenente,” he said. “I can’t understand them. Hey!” he put his hand on the
            girl’s thigh and squeezed it in a friendly way. The girl drew her shawl tight around her
            and pushed his hand away. “Hey!” he said. “Tell the Tenente your name and what you’re
            doing here.”</p>
        <p>The girl looked at me fiercely. The other girl kept her eyes down. The girl who looked at
            me said something in a dialect I could not understand a word of. She was plump and dark
            and looked about sixteen.</p>
        <p>“Sorella?” I asked and pointed at the other girl.</p>
        <p>She nodded her head and smiled.</p>
        <p>“All right,” I said and patted her knee. I felt her stiffen away when I touched her. The
            sister never
            
            <pb n="209"/>
            
            looked up. She looked perhaps a year younger. Aymo put his hand on the elder girl’s thigh
            and she pushed it away. He laughed at her.</p>
        <p>“Good man,” he pointed at himself. “Good man,” he pointed at me. “Don’t you worry.” The
            girl looked at him fiercely. The pair of them were like two wild birds.</p>
        <p>“What does she ride with me for if she doesn’t like me?” Aymo asked. “They got right up
            in the car the minute I motioned to them.” He turned to the girl. “Don’t worry,” he
            said. “No danger of ----,” using the vulgar word. “No place for ----.” I could see she
            understood the word and that was all. Her eyes looked at him very scared. She pulled the
            shawl tight. “Car all full,” Aymo said. “No danger of ----. No place for ----.” Every time
            he said the word the girl stiffened a little. Then sitting stiffly and looking at him
            she began to cry. I saw her lips working and then tears came down her plump cheeks. Her
            sister, not looking up, took her hand and they sat there together. The older one, who
            had been so fierce, began to sob.</p>
        <p>“I guess I scared her,” Aymo said. “I didn’t mean to scare her.”</p>
        <p>Bartolomeo brought out his knapsack and cut off two pieces of cheese. “Here,” he said.
            “Stop crying.”</p>
        <p>The older girl shook her head and still cried, but the younger girl took the cheese and
            commenced to eat. After a while the younger girl gave her sister the second piece of
            cheese and they both ate. The older sister still sobbed a little.</p>
        <p>“She’ll be all right after a while,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>An idea came to him. “Virgin?” he asked the girl next to him. She nodded her head
            vigorously. “Virgin too ?” he pointed to the sister. Both the girls nodded
            
            <pb n="210"/>

    their heads and the elder said something in dialect.</p>
        <p>“That’s all right,” Bartolomeo said. “That’s all right.”</p>
        <p>Both the girls seemed cheered.</p>
        <p>I left them sitting together with Aymo sitting back in the corner and went back to
            Piani’s car. The column of vehicles did not move but the troops kept passing alongside.
            It was still raining hard and I thought some of the stops in the movement of the column
            might be from cars with wet wiring. More likely they were from horses or men going to
            sleep. Still, traffic could tie up in cities when every one was awake. It was the
            combination of horse and motor vehicles. They did not help each other any. The peasants’
            carts did not help much either. Those were a couple of fine girls with Barto. A retreat
            was no place for two virgins. Real virgins. Probably very religious. If there were no
            war we would probably all be in bed. In bed I lay me down my head. Bed and board. Stiff
            as a board in bed. Catherine was in bed now between two sheets, over her and under her.
            Which side did she sleep on? Maybe she wasn’t asleep. Maybe she was lying thinking about
            me. Blow, blow, ye western wind. Well, it blew and it wasn’t the small rain but the big
            rain down that rained. It rained all night. You knew it rained down that rained. Look at
            it. Christ, that my love were in my arms and I in my bed again. That my love Catherine.
            That my sweet love Catherine down might rain. Blow her again to me. Well, we were in it.
            Every one was caught in it and the small rain would not quiet it. Good-night,
            Catherine,” I said out loud. “I hope you sleep well. If it’s too uncomfortable, darling,
            lie on the other side,” I said. “I’ll get you some cold water. In a little while it will
            be morning and then it won’t be so
            
            <pb n="211"/>
            
            bad. I’m sorry he makes you so uncomfortable. Try and go to sleep, sweet.”</p>
        <p>I was asleep all the time, she said. You’ve been talking in your sleep. Are you all
            right?</p>
        <p>Are you really there ?</p>
        <p>Of course I’m here. I wouldn’t go way. This doesn’t make any difference between us.</p>
        <p>You’re so lovely and sweet You wouldn’t go away in the night, would you?</p>
        <p>Of course I wouldn’t go away. I’m always here. I come whenever you want me.</p>
        <p>“----,” Piani said. “They’ve started again.”</p>
        <p>“I was dopey,” I said. I looked at my watch. It was three o’clock in the morning. I
            reached back behind the seat for a bottle of the barbera.</p>
        <p>“You talked out loud,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“I was having a dream in English,” I said.</p>
        <p>The rain was slacking and we were moving along. Before daylight we were stalled again and
            when it was light we were at a little rise in the ground and I saw the road of the
            retreat stretched out far ahead, everything stationary except for the infantry filtering
            through. We started to move again but seeing the rate of progress in the daylight, I
            knew we were going to have to get off that main road some way and go across country if
            we ever hoped to reach Udine.</p>
        <p>In the night many peasants had joined the column from the roads of the country and in the
            column there were carts loaded with household goods; there were mirrors projecting up
            between mattresses, and chickens and ducks tied to carts. There was a sewing-machine on
            the cart ahead of us in the rain. They had saved the most valuable things. On some carts
            the women sat
            
            <pb n="212"/>
            
            huddled from the rain and others walked beside the carts keeping as close to them as they
            could. There were dogs now in the column, keeping under the wagons as they moved along.
            The road was muddy, the ditches at the side were high with water and beyond the trees
            that lined the road the fields looked too wet and too soggy to try to cross. I got down
            from the car and worked up the road a way, looking for a place where I could see ahead
            to find a side-road we could take across country. I knew there were many side-roads but
            did not want one that would lead to nothing. I could not remember them because we had
            always passed them bowling along in the car on the main road and they all looked much
            alike. Now I knew we must find one if we hoped to get through. No one knew where the
            Austrians were nor how things were going but I was certain that if the rain should stop
            and planes come over and get to work on that column that it would be all over. All that
            was needed was for a few men to leave their trucks or a few horses be killed to tie up
            completely the movement on the road.</p>
        <p>The rain was not falling so heavily now and I thought it might clear. I went ahead along
            the edge of the road and when there was a small road that led off to the north between
            two fields with a hedge of trees on both sides, I thought that we had better take it and
            hurried back to the cars. I told Piani to turn off and went back to tell Bonello and
            Aymo.</p>
        <p>“If it leads nowhere we can turn around and cut back in,” I said.</p>
        <p>“What about these?” Bonello asked. His two sergeants were beside him on the seat. They
            were unshaven but still military looking in the early morning.</p>
        <p>“They’ll be good to push,” I said. I went back to
            
            <pb n="213"/>
            
            Aymo and told him we were going to try it across country.</p>
        <p>“What about my virgin family?” Aymo asked. The two girls were asleep.</p>
        <p>“They won’t be very useful,” I said. “You ought to have some one that could push.”</p>
        <p>“They could go back in the car,” Aymo said. “There’s room in the car.”</p>
        <p>“All right if you want them,” I said. “Pick up somebody with a wide back to push.”</p>
        <p>“Bersaglieri,” Aymo smiled. “They have the widest backs. They measure them. How do you
            feel, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“Fine. How are you?”</p>
        <p>“Fine. But very hungry.”</p>
        <p>“There ought to be something up that road and we will stop and eat.”</p>
        <p>“How’s your leg, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“Fine,” I said. Standing on the step and looking up ahead I could see Piani’s car pulling
            out onto the little side-road and starting up it, his car showing through the hedge of
            bare branches. Bonello turned off and followed him and then Piani worked his way out and
            we followed the two ambulances ahead along the narrow road between hedges. It led to a
            farmhouse. We found Piani and Bonello stopped in the farmyard. The house was low and
            long with a trellis with a grape-vine over the door. There was a well in the yard and
            Piani was getting up water to fill his radiator. So much going in low gear had boiled it
            out. The farmhouse was deserted. I looked back down the road, the farmhouse was on a
            slight elevation above the plain, and we could see over the country, and saw the road,
            the hedges, the fields and the line of trees along the main road where
            
            <pb n="214"/>
            
            the retreat was passing. The two sergeants were looking through the house. The girls were
            awake and looking at the courtyard, the well and the two big ambulances in front of the
            farmhouse, with three drivers at the well. One of the sergeants came out with a clock in
            his hand.</p>
        <p>“Put it back,” I said. He looked at me, went in the house and came back without the
            clock.</p>
        <p>“Where’s your partner?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“He’s gone to the latrine.” He got up on the seat of the ambulance. He was afraid we
            would leave him.</p>
        <p>“What about breakfast, Tenente?” Bonello asked. “We could eat something. It wouldn’t take
            very long.”</p>
        <p>“Do you think this road going down on the other side will lead to anything?”</p>
        <p>“Sure.”</p>
        <p>“All right. Let’s eat.” Piani and Bonello went in the house.</p>
        <p>“Come on,” Aymo said to the girls. He held his hand to help them down. The older sister
            shook her head. They were not going into any deserted house. They looked after us.</p>
        <p>“They are difficult,” Aymo said. We went into the farmhouse together. It was large and
            dark, an abandoned feeling. Bonello and Piani were in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>“There’s not much to eat,” Piani said. “They’ve cleaned it out.”</p>
        <p>Bonello sliced a big white cheese on the heavy kitchen table.</p>
        <p>“Where was the cheese?”</p>
        <p>“In the cellar. Piani found wine too and apples.”</p>
        <p>“That’s a good breakfast.”</p>
        <p>Piani was taking the wooden cork out of a big wicker-covered
            
            <pb n="215"/>
            
            wine jug. He tipped it and poured a copper pan full.</p>
        <p>“It smells all right,” he said. “Find some beakers, Barto.”</p>
        <p>The two sergeants came in.</p>
        <p>“Have some cheese, sergeants,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“We should go,” one of the sergeants said, eating his cheese and drinking a cup of
            wine.</p>
        <p>“We’ll go. Don’t worry,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“An army travels on its stomach,” I said.</p>
        <p>“What?” asked the sergeant.</p>
        <p>“It’s better to eat.”</p>
        <p>“Yes. But time is precious.”</p>
        <p>“I believe the bastards have eaten already,” Piani said. The sergeants looked at him.
            They hated the lot of us.</p>
        <p>“You know the road?” one of them asked me.</p>
        <p>“No,” I said. They looked at each other.</p>
        <p>“We would do best to start,” the first one said.</p>
        <p>“We are starting,” I said. I drank another cup of the red wine. It tasted very good after
            the cheese and apple.</p>
        <p>“Bring the cheese,” I said and went out Bonello came out carrying the great jug of
            wine.</p>
        <p>“That’s too big,” I said. He looked at it regretfully.</p>
        <p>“I guess it is,” he said. “Give me the canteens to fill.” He filled the canteens and some
            of the wine ran out on the stone paving of the courtyard. Then he picked up the wine jug
            and put it just inside the door.</p>
        <p>“The Austrians can find it without breaking the door down,” he said.</p>
        <p>“We’ll roll,” I said. “Piani and I will go ahead.” The two engineers were already on the
            seat beside Bonello. The girls were eating cheese and apples. Aymo
            
            <pb n="216"/>
            
            was smoking. We started off down the narrow road. I looked back at the two cars coming
            and the farmhouse. It was a fine, low, solid stone house and the ironwork of the well
            was very good. Ahead of us the road was narrow and muddy and there was a high hedge on
            either side. Behind, the cars were following closely.</p>

        <div type="chapter" n="29">

            <p>CHAPTER XXIX</p>
       
        <p>At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about, as nearly as we could figure, ten kilometres
            from Udine. The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three times we had heard planes
            coming, seen them pass overhead, watched them go far to the left and heard them bombing
            on the main highroad. We had worked through a network of secondary roads and had taken
            many roads that were blind, but had always, by backing up and finding another road,
            gotten closer to Udine. Now, Aymo’s car, in backing so that we might get out of a blind
            road, had gotten into the soft earth at the side and the wheels, spinning, had dug
            deeper and deeper until the car rested on its differential. The thing to do now was to
            dig out in front of the wheels, put in brush so that the chains could grip, and then
            push until the car was on the road. We were all down on the road around the car. The two
            sergeants looked at the car and examined the wheels. Then they started off down the road
            without a word. I went after them.</p>
        <p>“Come on,” I said. “Cut some brush.”</p>
        <p>“We have to go,” one said.</p>
        <p>“Get busy,” I said, “and cut brush.”</p>
        <p>“We have to go,” one said. The other said nothing. They were in a hurry to start. They
            would not look at me.</p>
        <p>“I order you to come back to the car and cut brush,” I said. The one sergeant turned. “We
            have to go on. In a little while you will be cut off. You can’t order us. You’re not our
            officer.”</p>
        <p>“I order you to cut brush,” I said. They turned and started down the road.</p>
            
            <pb n="218"/>
            
        <p>“Halt,” I said. They kept on down the muddy road, the hedge on either side. “I order you
            to halt,” I called. They went a little faster. I opened up my holster, took the pistol,
            aimed at the one who had talked the most, and fired. I missed and they both started to
            run. I shot three times and dropped one. The other went through the hedge and was out of
            sight. I fired at him through the hedge as he ran across the field. The pistol clicked
            empty and I put in another clip. I saw it was too far to shoot at the second sergeant.
            He was far across the field, running, his head held low. I commenced to reload the empty
            clip. Bonello came up.</p>
        <p>“Let me go finish him,” he said. I handed him the pistol and he walked down to where the
            sergeant of engineers lay face down across the road. Bonello leaned over, put the pistol
            against the man’s head and pulled the trigger. The pistol did not fire.</p>
        <p>“You have to cock it,” I said. He cocked it and fired twice. He took hold of the
            sergeant’s legs and pulled him to the side of the road so he lay beside the hedge. He
            came back and handed me the pistol.</p>
        <p>“The son of a bitch,” he said. He looked toward the sergeant. “You see me shoot him,
            Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“We’ve got to get the brush quickly,” I said. “Did I hit the other one at all ?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so,” Aymo said. “He was too far away to hit with a pistol.”</p>
        <p>“The dirty scum,” Piani said. We were all cutting twigs and branches. Everything had been
            taken out of the car. Bonello was digging out in front of the wheels. When we were ready
            Aymo started the car and put it into gear. The wheels spun round throwing brush and mud.
            Bonello and I pushed until we could feel our joints crack. The car would not move.</p>
            
            <pb n="219"/>
            
        <p>“Rock her back and forth, Barto,” I said.</p>
        <p>He drove the engine in reverse, then forward. The wheels only dug in deeper. Then the car
            was resting on the differential again, and the wheels spun freely in the holes they had
            dug. I straightened up.</p>
        <p>“We’ll try her with a rope,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think it’s any use, Tenente. You can’t get a straight pull.”</p>
        <p>“We have to try it,” I said. “She won’t come out any other way.”</p>
        <p>Piani’s and Bonello’s cars could only move straight ahead down the narrow road. We roped
            both cars together and pulled. The wheels only pulled sideways against the ruts.</p>
        <p>“It’s no good,” I shouted. “Stop it.”</p>
        <p>Piani and Bonello got down from their cars and came back. Aymo got down. The girls were
            up the road about forty yards sitting on a stone wall.</p>
        <p>“What do you say, Tenente?” Bonello asked.</p>
        <p>“We’ll dig out and try once more with the brush,” I said. I looked down the road. It was
            my fault. I had led them up here. The sun was almost out from behind the clouds and the
            body of the sergeant lay beside the hedge.</p>
        <p>“We’ll put his coat and cape under,” I said. Bonello went to get them. I cut brush and
            Aymo and Piani dug out in front and between the wheels. I cut the cape, then ripped it
            in two, and laid it under the wheel in the mud, then piled brush for the wheels to
            catch. We were ready to start and Aymo got up on the seat and started the car. The
            wheels spun and we pushed and pushed. But it wasn’t any use.</p>
        <p>“It’s ----ed,” I said. “Is there anything you want in the car, Barto ?”</p>
            
            <pb n="220"/>
            
        <p>Aymo climbed up with Bonello, carrying the cheese and two bottles of wine and his cape.
            Bonello, sitting behind the wheel, was looking through the pockets of the sergeant’s
            coat.</p>
        <p>“Better throw the coat away,” I said. “What about Barto’s virgins?”</p>
        <p>“They can get in the back,” Piani said. “I don’t think we are going far.”</p>
        <p>I opened the back door of the ambulance.</p>
        <p>“Come on,” I said. “Get in.” The two girls climbed in and sat in the corner. They seemed
            to have taken no notice of the shooting. I looked back up the road. The sergeant lay in
            his dirty long-sleeved underwear. I got up with Piani and we started. We were going to
            try to cross the field. When the road entered the field I got down and walked ahead. If
            we could get across, there was a road on the other side. We could not get across. It was
            too soft and muddy for the cars. When they were finally and completely stalled, the
            wheels dug in to the hubs, we left them in the field and started on foot for Udine.</p>
        <p>When we came to the road which led back toward the main highway I pointed down it to the
            two girls.</p>
        <p>“Go down there,” I said. “You’ll meet people.” They looked at me. I took out my
            pocket-book and gave them each a ten-lira note. “Go down there,” I said, pointing.
            “Friends! Family!”</p>
        <p>They did not understand but they held the money tightly and started down the road. They
            looked back as though they were afraid I might take the money back. I watched them go
            down the road, their shawls close around them, looking back apprehensively at us. The
            three drivers were laughing.</p>
            
            <pb n="221"/>
            
        <p>“How much will you give me to go in that direction, Tenente?” Bonello asked.</p>
        <p>“They’re better off in a bunch of people than alone if they catch them,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Give me two hundred lire and I’ll walk straight back toward Austria,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“They’d take it away from you,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“Maybe the war will be over,” Aymo said. We were going up the road as fast as we could.
            The sun was trying to come through. Beside the road were mulberry trees. Through the
            trees I could see our two big moving-vans of cars stuck in the field. Piani looked back
            too.</p>
        <p>“They’ll have to build a road to get them out,” he said.</p>
        <p>“I wish to Christ we had bicycles,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“Do they ride bicycles in America?” Aymo asked.</p>
        <p>“They used to.”</p>
        <p>“Here it is a great thing,” Aymo said. “A bicycle is a splendid thing.”</p>
        <p>“I wish to Christ we had bicycles,” Bonello said. “I’m no walker.”</p>
        <p>“Is that firing?” I asked. I thought I could hear firing a long way away.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” Aymo said. He listened.</p>
        <p>“I think so,” I said.</p>
        <p>“The first thing we will see will be the cavalry,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“I don’t think they’ve got any cavalry.”</p>
        <p>“I hope to Christ not,” Bonello said. “I don’t want to be stuck on a lance by
            any ---- cavalry.”</p>
        <p>“You certainly shot that sergeant, Tenente,” Piani said. We were walking fast.</p>
        <p>“I killed him,” Bonello said. “I never killed anybody
            
            <pb n="222"/>
            
            in this war, and all my life I’ve wanted to kill a sergeant.”</p>
        <p>‘‘You killed him on the sit all right,” Piani said. “He wasn’t flying very fast when you
            killed him.”</p>
        <p>“Never mind. That’s one thing I can always remember. I killed that ---- of a
            sergeant.”</p>
        <p>“What will you say in confession?” Aymo asked.</p>
        <p>“I’ll say, ‘Bless me, father, I killed a sergeant.’” They all laughed.</p>
        <p>“He’s an anarchist,” Piani said. “He doesn’t go to church.”</p>
        <p>“Piani’s an anarchist too,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“Are you really anarchists ?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“No, Tenente. We’re socialists. We come from Imola.”</p>
        <p>“Haven’t you ever been there?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“By Christ it’s a fine place, Tenente. You come there after the war and we’ll show you
            something.”</p>
        <p>“Are you all socialists?”</p>
        <p>“Everybody.”</p>
        <p>“Is it a fine town?”</p>
        <p>“Wonderful. You never saw a town like that.”</p>
        <p>“How did you get to be socialists?”</p>
        <p>“We’re all socialists. Everybody is a socialist. We’ve always been socialists.”</p>
        <p>“You come, Tenente. We’ll make you a socialist too.”</p>
        <p>Ahead the road turned off to the left and there was a little hill and, beyond a stone
            wall, an apple orchard. As the road went uphill they ceased talking. We walked along
            together all going fast against time.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER XXX</head>

        <p>Later we were on a road that led to a river. There was a long line of abandoned trucks
            and carts on the road leading up to the bridge. No one was in sight. The river was high
            and the bridge had been blown up in the centre; the stone arch was fallen into the river
            and the brown water was going over it. We went on up the bank looking for a place to
            cross. Up ahead I knew there was a railway bridge and I thought we might be able to get
            across there. The path was wet and muddy. We did not see any troops; only abandoned
            trucks and stores. Along the river bank there was nothing and no one but the wet brush
            and muddy ground. We went up to the bank and finally we saw the railway bridge.</p>
        <p>“What a beautiful bridge,” Aymo said. It was a long plain iron bridge across what was
            usually a dry river-bed.</p>
        <p>“We better hurry and get across before they blow it up,” I said.</p>
        <p>“There’s nobody to blow it up,” Piani said. “They’re all gone.”</p>
        <p>“It’s probably mined,” Bonello said. “You cross first, Tenente.”</p>
        <p>“Listen to the anarchist,” Aymo said. “Make him go first.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll go,” I said. “It won’t be mined to blow up with one man.”</p>
        <p>“You see,” Piani said. “That is brains. Why haven’t you brains, anarchist ?”</p>
            
            <pb n="224"/>
            
        <p>“If I had brains I wouldn’t be here,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“That’s pretty good, Tenente,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“That’s pretty good,” I said. We were close to the bridge now. The sky had clouded over
            again and it was raining a little. The bridge looked long and solid. We climbed up the
            embankment.</p>
        <p>“Come one at a time,” I said and started across the bridge. I watched the ties and the
            rails for any tripwires or signs of explosive but I saw nothing. Down below the gaps in
            the ties the river ran muddy and fast. Ahead across the wet countryside I could see
            Udine in the rain. Across the bridge I looked back. Just up the river was another
            bridge. As I watched, a yellow mud-colored motor car crossed it. The sides of the bridge
            were high and the body of the car, once on, was out of sight. But I saw the heads of the
            driver, the man on the seat with him, and the two men on the rear seat. They all wore
            German helmets. Then the car was over the bridge and out of sight behind the trees and
            the abandoned vehicles on the road. I waved to Aymo who was crossing and to the others
            to come on. I climbed down and crouched beside the railway embankment. Aymo came down
            with me.</p>
        <p>“Did you see the car?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“No. We were watching you.”</p>
        <p>“A German staff car crossed on the upper bridge.”</p> 
        <p>“A staff car?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Holy Mary.”</p>
        <p>The others came and we all crouched in the mud behind the embankment, looking across the
            rails at the bridge, the line of trees, the ditch and the road.</p>
        <p>“Do you think we’re cut off then, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. All I know is a German staff car went along that road.”</p>
            
            <pb n="225"/>
            
        <p>“You don’t feel funny, Tenente? You haven’t got strange feelings in the head?”</p>
        <p>“Don’t be funny, Bonello.”</p>
        <p>“What about a drink?” Piani asked. “If we’re cut off we might as well have a drink.” He
            unhooked his canteen and uncorked it</p>
        <p>“Look! Look!” Aymo said and pointed toward the road. Along the top of the stone bridge we
            could see German helmets moving. They were bent forward and moved smoothly, almost
            supernaturally, along. As they came off the bridge we saw them. They were bicycle
            troops. I saw the faces of the first two. They were ruddy and healthy-looking. Their
            helmets came low down over their foreheads and the side of their faces. Their carbines
            were clipped to the frame of the bicycles. Stick bombs hung handle down from their
            belts. Their helmets and their gray uniforms were wet and they rode easily, looking
            ahead and to both sides. There were two--then four in line, then two, then almost a
            dozen; then another dozen--then one alone. They did not talk but we could not have heard
            them because of the noise from the river. They were gone out of sight up the road.</p>
        <p>“Holy Mary,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“They were Germans,” Piani said. “Those weren’t Austrians.”</p>
        <p>“Why isn’t there somebody here to stop them?” I said. “Why haven’t they blown the bridge
            up? Why aren’t there machine-guns along this embankment?”</p>
        <p>“You tell us, Tenente,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>I was very angry.</p>
        <p>“The whole bloody thing is crazy. Down below they blow up a little bridge. Here they
            leave a bridge on the main road. Where is everybody? Don’t they try and stop them at
            all?”</p>
            
            <pb n="226"/>
            
        <p>“You tell us, Tenente,” Bonello said. I shut up. It was none of my business; all I had to
            do was to get to Pordenone with three ambulances. I had failed at that. All I had to do
            now was get to Pordenone. I probably could not even get to Udine. The hell I couldn't.
            The thing to do was to be calm and not get shot or captured.</p>
        <p>“Didn’t you have a canteen open?” I asked Piani. He handed it to me. I took a long drink.
            “We might as well start,” I said. “There’s no hurry though. Do you want to eat
            something?”</p>
        <p>“This is no place to stay,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“All right. We’ll start.”</p>
        <p>“Should we keep on this side-—out of sight?”</p>
        <p>“We’ll be better off on top. They may come along this bridge too. We don’t want them on
            top of us before we see them.”</p>
        <p>We walked along the railroad track. On both sides of us stretched the wet plain. Ahead
            across the plain was the hill of Udine. The roofs fell away from the castle on the hill.
            We could see the campanile and the clock-tower. There were many mulberry trees in the
            fields. Ahead I saw a place where the rails were torn up. The ties had been dug out too
            and thrown down the embankment.</p>
        <p>“Down! down!” Aymo said. We dropped down beside the embankment. There was another group
            of bicyclists passing along the road. I looked over the edge and saw them go on.</p>
        <p>“They saw us but they went on,” Aymo said.</p>
        <p>“We’ll get killed up there, Tenente,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“They don’t want us,” I said. “They’re after something else. We’re in more danger if they
            should come on us suddenly.”</p>
            
            <pb n="227"/>
            
        <p>“I’d rather walk here out of sight,” Bonello said.</p> 
        <p>“All right. We’ll walk along the
            tracks.”</p>
        <p>“Do you think we can get through?” Aymo asked.</p>
        <p>“Sure. There aren’t very many of them yet. We’ll go through in the dark.”</p>
        <p>“What was that staff car doing?”</p>
        <p>“Christ knows,” I said. We kept on up the tracks. Bonello tired of walking in the mud of
            the embankment and came up with the rest of us. The railway moved south away from the
            highway now and we could not see what passed along the road. A short bridge over a canal
            was blown up but we climbed across on what was left of the span. We heard firing ahead
            of us.</p>
        <p>We came up on the railway beyond the canal. It went on straight toward the town across
            the low fields. We could see the line of the other railway ahead of us. To the north was
            the main road where we had seen the cyclists; to the south there was a small branch-road
            across the fields with thick trees on each side. I thought we had better cut to the
            south and work around the town that way and across country toward Campoformio and the
            main road to the Tagliamento. We could avoid the main line of the retreat by keeping to
            the secondary roads beyond Udine. I knew there were plenty of side-roads across the
            plain. I started down the embankment.</p>
        <p>“Come on,” I said. We would make for the sideroad and work to the south of the town. We
            all started down the embankment. A shot was fired at us from the side-road. The bullet
            went into the mud of the embankment.</p>
        <p>“Go on back,” I shouted. I started up the embankment, slipping in the mud. The drivers
            were ahead of
            
            <pb n="228"/>
            
            me. I went up the embankment as fast as I could go. Two more shots came from the thick
            brush and Aymo, as he was crossing the tracks, lurched, tripped and fell face down. We
            pulled him down on the other side and turned him over. “His head ought to be uphill,” I
            said. Piani moved him around. He lay in the mud on the side of the embankment, his feet
            pointing downhill, breathing blood irregularly. The three of us squatted over him in the
            rain. He was hit low in the back of the neck and the bullet had ranged upward and come
            out under the right eye. He died while I was stopping up the two holes. Piani laid his
            head down, wiped at his face, with a piece of the emergency dressing, then let it
            alone.</p>
        <p>“The- ----,” he said.</p>
        <p>“They weren’t Germans,” I said. “There can’t be any Germans over there.”</p>
        <p>“Italians,” Piani said, using the word as an epithet, “Italiani!” Bonello said nothing.
            He was sitting beside Aymo, not looking at him. Piani picked up Aymo’s cap where it had
            rolled down the embankment and put it over his face. He took out his canteen.</p>
        <p>“Do you want a drink?” Piani handed Bonello the canteen.</p>
        <p>“No,” Bonello said. He turned to me. “That might have happened to us any time on the
            railway tracks.”</p>
        <p>“No,” I said. “It was because we started across the field.”</p>
        <p>Bonello shook his head. “Aymo’s dead,” he said. “Who’s dead next, Tenente? Where do we go
            now?”</p>
        <p>“Those were Italians that shot,” I said. “They weren’t Germans.”</p>
        <p>“I suppose if they were Germans they’d have killed all of us,” Bonello said.</p>
            
            <pb n="229"/>
            
        <p>“We are in more danger from Italians than Germans,” I said. “The rear guard are afraid of
            everything. The Germans know what they’re after.”</p>
        <p>“You reason it out, Tenente,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“Where do we go now?” Piani asked.</p>
        <p>“We better lie up some place till it’s dark. If we could get south we’d be all
            right.”</p>
        <p>“They’d have to shoot us all to prove they were right the first time,” Bonello said. “I’m
            not going to try them.”</p>
        <p>“We’ll find a place to lie up as near to Udine as we can get and then go through when
            it’s dark.”</p>
        <p>“Let’s go then,” Bonello said. We went down the north side of the embankment. I looked
            back. Aymo lay in the mud with the angle of the embankment. He was quite small and his
            arms were by his side, his puttee-wrapped legs and muddy boots together, his cap over
            his face. He looked very dead. It was raining. I had liked him as well as any one I ever
            knew. I had his papers in my pocket and would write to his family. Ahead across the
            fields was a farmhouse. There were trees around it and the farm buildings were built
            against the house. There was a balcony along the second floor held up by columns.</p>
        <p>“We better keep a little way apart,” I said. “I’ll go ahead.” I started toward the
            farmhouse. There was a path across the field.</p>
        <p>Crossing the field, I did not know but that some one would fire on us from the trees near
            the farmhouse or from the farmhouse itself. I walked toward it, seeing it very clearly.
            The balcony of the second floor merged into the barn and there was hay coming out
            between the columns. The courtyard was of stone blocks and all the trees were dripping
            with the rain. There was a
            
            <pb n="230"/>
            
            big empty two-wheeled cart, the shafts tipped high up in the rain. I came to the
            courtyard, crossed it, and stood under the shelter of the balcony. The door of the house
            was open and I went in. Bonello and Piani came in after me. It was dark inside. I went
            back to the kitchen. There were ashes of a fire on the big open hearth. The pots hung
            over the ashes, but they were empty. I looked around but I could not find anything to
            eat.</p>
        <p>“We ought to lie up in the barn,” I said. “Do you think you could find anything to eat,
            Piani, and bring it up there?”</p>
        <p>“I’ll look,” Piani said.</p>
        <p>“I’ll look too,” Bonello said.</p>
        <p>“All right,” I said. “I’ll go up and look at the barn.” I found a stone stairway that
            went up from the stable underneath. The stable smelt dry and pleasant in the rain. The
            cattle were all gone, probably driven off when they left. The barn was half full of hay.
            There were two windows in the roof, one was blocked with boards, the other was a narrow
            dormer window on the north side. There was a chute so that hay might be pitched down to
            the cattle. Beams crossed the opening down into the main floor where the haycarts drove
            in when the hay was hauled in to be pitched up. I heard the rain on the roof and smelled
            the hay and, when I went down, the clean smell of dried dung in the stable. We could pry
            a board loose and see out of the south window down into the courtyard. The other window
            looked out on the field toward the north. We could get out of either window onto the
            roof and down, or go down the hay chute if the stairs were impractical. It was a big
            barn and we could hide in the hay if we heard any one. It seemed like a good place.
            
            <pb n="231"/>
            
            I was sure we could have gotten through to the south if they had not fired on us. It was
            impossible that there were Germans there. They were coming from the north and down the
            road from Cividale. They could not have come through from the south. The Italians were
            even more dangerous. They were frightened and firing on anything they saw. Last night on
            the retreat we had heard that there had been many Germans in Italian uniforms mixing
            with the retreat in the north. I did not believe it. That was one of those things you
            always heard in the war. It was one of the things the enemy always did to you. You did
            not know any one who went over in German uniform to confuse them. Maybe they did but it
            sounded difficult. I did not believe the Germans did it. I did not believe they had to.
            There was no need to confuse our retreat. The size of the army and the fewness of the
            roads did that. Nobody gave any orders, let alone Germans. Still, they would shoot us
            for Germans. They shot Aymo. The hay smelled good and lying in a barn in the hay took
            away all the years in between. We had lain in hay and talked and shot sparrows with an
            air-rifle when they perched in the triangle cut high up in the wall of the barn. The
            barn was gone now and one year they had cut the hemlock woods and there were only
            stumps, dried tree-tops, branches and fireweed where the woods had been. You could not
            go back. If you did not go forward what happened? You never got back to Milan. And if
            you got back to Milan what happened? I listened to the firing to the north toward Udine.
            I could hear machine-gun firing. There was no shelling. That was something. They must
            have gotten some troops along the road. I looked down in the half-light of the hay-barn
            and saw Piani standing on the hauling
            
            <pb n="232"/>
            
            floor. He had a long sausage, a jar of something and two bottles of wine under his
            arm.</p>
        <p>“Come up,” I said. “There is the ladder.” Then I realized that I should help him with the
            things and went down. I was vague in the head from lying in the hay. I had been nearly
            asleep.</p>
        <p>“Where’s Bonello?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“I’ll tell you,” Piani said. We went up the ladder. Up on the hay we set the things down.
            Piani took out his knife with the corkscrew and drew the cork on a wine bottle.</p>
        <p>“They have sealing-wax on it,” he said. “It must be good.” He smiled.</p>
        <p>“Where’s Bonello?” I asked.</p>
        <p>Piani looked at me.</p>
        <p>“He went away, Tenente,” he said. “He wanted to be a prisoner.”</p>
        <p>I did not say anything.</p>
        <p>“He was afraid we would get killed.”</p>
        <p>I held the bottle of wine and did not say anything.</p>
        <p>“You see we don’t believe in the war anyway, Tenente.”</p>
        <p>“Why didn’t you go?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“I did not want to leave you.”</p>
        <p>“Where did he go?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know, Tenente. He went away.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” I said. “Will you cut the sausage?”</p> 
        <p>Piani looked at me in the
            half-light.</p>
        <p>“I cut it while we were talking,” he said. We sat in the hay and ate the sausage and
            drank the wine. It must have been wine they had saved for a wedding. It was so old that
            it was losing its color.</p>
        <p>“You look out of this window, Luigi,” I said. “I’ll go look out the other window.”</p>
            
            <pb n="233"/>
            
        <p>We had each been drinking out of one of the bottles and I took my bottle with me and went
            over and lay flat on the hay and looked out the narrow window at the wet country. I do
            not know what I expected to see but I did not see anything except the fields and the
            bare mulberry trees and the rain falling. I drank the wine and it did not make me feel
            good. They had kept it too long and it had gone to pieces and lost its quality and
            color. I watched it get dark outside; the darkness came very quickly. It would be a
            black night with the rain. When it was dark there was no use watching any more, so I
            went over to Piani. He was lying asleep and I did not wake him but sat down beside him
            for a while. He was a big man and he slept heavily. After a while I woke him and we
            started.</p>
        <p>That was a very strange night. I do not know what I had expected, death perhaps and
            shooting in the dark and running, but nothing happened. We waited, lying flat beyond the
            ditch along the main road while a German battalion passed, then when they were gone we
            crossed the road and went on to the north. We were very close to Germans twice in the
            rain but they did not see us. We got past the town to the north without seeing any
            Italians, then after a while came on the main channels of the retreat and walked all
            night toward the Tagliamento. I had not realized how gigantic the retreat was. The whole
            country was moving, as well as the army. We walked all night, making better time than
            the vehicles. My leg ached and I was tired but we made good time. It seemed so silly for
            Bonello to have decided to be taken prisoner. There was no danger. We had walked through
            two armies without incident. If Aymo had not been killed there would never have seemed
            to be any danger. No one had
            
            <pb n="234"/>
            
            bothered us when we were in plain sight along the railway. The killing came suddenly and
            unreasonably. I wondered where Bonello was.</p>
        <p>“How do you feel, Tenente?” Piani asked. We were going along the side of a road crowded
            with vehicles and troops.</p>
        <p>“Fine.”</p>
        <p>“I’m tired of this walking.”</p>
        <p>“Well, all we have to do is walk now. We don’t have to worry.”</p>
        <p>“Bonello was a fool.”</p>
        <p>“He was a fool all right.”</p>
        <p>“What will you do about him, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
        <p>“Can’t you just put him down as taken prisoner?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
        <p>“You see if the war went on they would make bad trouble for his family.”</p>
        <p>“The war won’t go on,” a soldier said. “We’re going home. The war is over.”</p>
        <p>“Everybody’s going home.”</p>
        <p>“We’re all going home.”</p>
        <p>“Come on, Tenente,” Piani said. He wanted to get past them.</p>
        <p>“Tenente? Who’s a Tenente? <hi>A basso gli ufficiali!</hi> Down with the
            officers!”</p>
        <p>Piani took me by the arm. “I better call you by your name,” he said. “They might try and
            make trouble. They’ve shot some officers.” We worked up past them.</p>
        <p>“I won’t make a report that will make trouble for his family.” I went on with our
            conversation.</p>
        <p>“If the war is over it makes no difference,” Piani said. “But I don’t believe it’s over.
            It’s too good that it should be over.”</p>
       
            <pb n="234"/>
            
        <p>“We’ll know pretty soon,” I said.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it’s over. They all think it’s over but I don’t believe it.”</p>
        <p><hi>“Viva la Pace!”</hi> a soldier shouted out. “We’re going home!”</p>
        <p>“It would be fine if we all went home,” Piani said. “Wouldn’t you like to go home?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“We’ll never go. I don’t think it’s over.”</p>
            <p><hi>“Andiamo a casa!”</hi> a soldier shouted.</p>
        <p>“They throw away their rifles,” Piani said. “They take them off and drop them down while
            they’re marching. Then they shout.”</p>
        <p>“They ought to keep their rifles.”</p>
        <p>“They think if they throw away their rifles they can’t make them fight.”</p>
        <p>In the dark and the rain, making our way along the side of the road I could see that many
            of the troops still had their rifles. They stuck up above the capes.</p>
        <p>“What brigade are you?” an officer called out.</p>
        <p><hi>“Brigata di Pace,”</hi> some one shouted. “Peace Brigade!” The officer
            said nothing.</p>
        <p>“What does he say? What does the officer say?”</p>
        <p>“Down with the officer. <hi>Viva la Pace!”</hi></p>
        <p>“Come on,” Piani said. We passed two British ambulances, abandoned in the block of
            vehicles.</p>
        <p>“They’re from Gorizia,” Piani said. “I know the cars.”</p>
        <p>“They got further than we did.”</p>
        <p>“They started earlier.”</p>
        <p>“I wonder where the drivers are?”</p>
        <p>“Up ahead probably.”</p>
        <p>“The Germans have stopped outside Udine,” I said. “These people will all get across the
            river.”</p>
            
            <pb n="236"/>
            
        <p>“Yes,” Piani said. “That’s why I think the war will go on.”</p>
        <p>“The Germans could come on,” I said. “I wonder why they don’t come on.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. I don’t know anything about this kind of war.”</p>
        <p>“They have to wait for their transport I suppose.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” Piani said. Alone he was much gentler. When he was with the others he was
            a very rough talker.</p>
        <p>“Are you married, Luigi?”</p>
        <p>“You know I am married.”</p>
        <p>“Is that why you did not want to be a prisoner?”</p>
        <p>“That is one reason. Are you married, Tenente?”</p>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“Neither is Bonello.”</p>
        <p>“You can’t tell anything by a man’s being married. But I should think a married man would
            want to get back to his wife,” I said. I would be glad to talk about wives.</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“How are your feet?”</p>
        <p>“They’re sore enough.”</p>
        <p>Before daylight we reached the bank of the Tagliamento and followed down along the
            flooded river to the bridge where all the traffic was crossing.</p>
        <p>“They ought to be able to hold at this river,” Piani said. In the dark the flood looked
            high. The water swirled and it was wide. The wooden bridge was nearly three-quarters of
            a mile across, and the river, that usually ran in narrow channels in the wide stony bed
            far below the bridge, was close under the wooden planking. We went along the bank and
            then worked
            
            <pb n="237"/>
            
            our way into the crowd that were crossing the bridge. Crossing slowly in the rain a few
            feet above the flood, pressed tight in the crowd, the box of an artillery caisson just
            ahead, I looked over the side and watched the river. Now that we could not go our own
            pace I felt very tired. There was no exhilaration in crossing the bridge. I wondered
            what it would be like if a plane bombed it in the daytime.</p>
        <p>“Piani,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Here I am, Tenente.” He was a little ahead in the jam. No one was talking. They were all
            trying to get across as soon as they could: thinking only of that. We were almost
            across. At the far end of the bridge there were officers and carabinieri standing on
            both sides flashing lights. I saw them silhouetted against the sky-line. As we came
            close to them I saw one of the officers point to a man in the column. A carabiniere went
            in after him and came out holding the man by the arm. He took him away from the road. We
            came almost opposite them. The officers were scrutinizing every one in the column,
            sometimes speaking to each other, going forward to flash a light in some one’s face.
            They took some one else out just before we came opposite. I saw the man. He was a
            lieutenant-colonel. I saw the stars in the box on his sleeve as they flashed a light on
            him. His hair was gray and he was short and fat. The carabiniere pulled him in behind
            the line of officers. As we came opposite I saw one or two of them look at me. Then one
            pointed at me and spoke to a carabiniere. I saw the carabiniere start for me, come
            through the edge of the column toward me, then felt him take me by the collar.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter with you?” I said and hit him in the face. I saw his face under the
            hat, upturned mustaches
            
            <pb n="238"/>
            
            and blood coming down his cheek. Another one dove in toward us.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter with you?” I said. He did not answer. He was watching a chance to
            grab me. I put my arm behind me to loosen my pistol.</p>
        <p>“Don’t you know you can’t touch an officer?”</p>
        <p>The other one grabbed me from behind and pulled my arm up so that it twisted in the
            socket. I turned with him and the other one grabbed me around the neck. I kicked his
            shins and got my left knee into his groin.</p>
        <p>“Shoot him if he resists,” I heard some one say.</p>
        <p>“What’s the meaning of this?” I tried to shout but my voice was not very loud. They
            had me at the side of the road now.</p>
        <p>“Shoot him if he resists,” an officer said. “Take him over back.”</p>
        <p>“Who are you?”</p>
        <p>“You’ll find out.”</p>
        <p>“Who are you?”</p>
        <p>“Battle police,” another officer said.</p>
        <p>“Why don’t you ask me to step over instead of having one of these airplanes grab me?”</p>
        <p>They did not answer. They did not have to answer. They were battle police.</p>
        <p>“Take him back there with the others,” the first officer said. “You see. He speaks
            Italian with an accent.”</p>
        <p>“So do you, you ----,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Take him back with the others,” the first officer said. They took me down behind the
            line of officers below the road toward a group of people in a field by the river bank.
            As we walked toward them shots were fired. I saw flashes of the rifles and heard the
            reports.
            
            <pb n="239"/>
            
            We came up to the group. There were four officers standing together, with a man in front
            of them with a carabiniere on each side of him. A group of men were standing guarded by
            carabinieri. Four other carabinieri stood near the questioning officers, leaning on
            their carbines. They were wide-hatted carabinieri. The two who had me shoved me in with
            the group waiting to be questioned. I looked at the man the officers were questioning.
            He was the fat gray-haired little lieutenant-colonel they had taken out of the column.
            The questioners had all the efficiency, coldness and command of themselves of Italians
            who are firing and are not being fired on.</p>
        <p>“Your brigade?”</p>
        <p>He told them.</p>
        <p>“Regiment?”</p>
        <p>He told them.</p>
        <p>“Why are you not with your regiment ?”</p>
        <p>He told them.</p>
        <p>“Do you not know that an officer should be with his troops ?”</p>
        <p>He did.</p>
        <p>That was all. Another officer spoke.</p>
        <p>“It is you and such as you that have let the barbarians onto the sacred soil of the
            fatherland.”</p>
        <p>“I beg your pardon,” said the lieutenant-colonel.</p>
        <p>“It is because of treachery such as yours that we have lost the fruits of victory.”</p>
        <p>“Have you ever been in a retreat?” the lieutenant-colonel asked.</p>
        <p>“Italy should never retreat.”</p>
        <p>We stood there in the rain and listened to this. We were facing the officers and the
            prisoner stood in front and a little to one side of us.</p>
            
            <pb n="240"/>
            
        <p>“If you are going to shoot me,” the lieutenant-colonel said, “please shoot me at once
            without further questioning. The questioning is stupid.” He made the sign of the cross.
            The officers spoke together. One wrote something on a pad of paper.</p>
        <p>“Abandoned his troops, ordered to be shot,” he said.</p>
        <p>Two carabinieri took the lieutenant-colonel to the river bank. He walked in the rain, an
            old man with his hat off, a carabiniere on either side. I did not watch them shoot him
            but I heard the shots. They were questioning some one else. This officer too was
            separated from his troops. He was not allowed to make an explanation. He cried when they
            read the sentence from the pad of paper, and they were questioning another when they
            shot him. They made a point of being intent on questioning the next man while the man
            who had been questioned before was being shot. In this way there was obviously nothing
            they could do about it. I did not know whether I should wait to be questioned or make a
            break now. I was obviously a German in Italian uniform. I saw how their minds worked; if
            they had minds and if they worked. They were all young men and they were saving their
            country. The second army was being re-formed beyond the Tagliamento. They were executing
            officers of the rank of major and above who were separated from their troops. They were
            also dealing summarily with German agitators in Italian uniform. They wore steel
            helmets. Only two of us had steel helmets. Some of the carabinieri had them. The other
            carabinieri wore the wide hat. Airplanes we called them. We stood in the rain and were
            taken out one at a time to be questioned and shot. So far they had shot every one they
            had questioned. The questioners had that beautiful detachment and devotion to stern
            justice
            
            <pb n="241"/>
            
            of men dealing in death without being in any danger of it. They were questioning a full
            colonel of a line regiment. Three more officers had just been put in with us.</p>
        <p>“Where was his regiment?”</p>
        <p>I looked at the carabinieri. They were looking at the newcomers. The others were looking
            at the colonel. I ducked down, pushed between two men, and ran for the river, my head
            down. I tripped at the edge and went in with a splash. The water was very cold and I
            stayed under as long as I could. I could feel the current swirl me and I stayed under
            until I thought I could never come up. The minute I came up I took a breath and went
            down again. It was easy to stay under with so much clothing and my boots. When I came up
            the second time I saw a piece of timber ahead of me and reached it and held on with one
            hand. I kept my head behind it and did not even look over it. I did not want to see the
            bank. There were shots when I ran and shots when I came up the first time. I heard them
            when I was almost above water. There were no shots now. The piece of timber swung in the
            current and I held it with one hand. I looked at the bank. It seemed to be going by very
            fast. There was much wood in the stream. The water was very cold. We passed the brush of
            an island above the water. I held onto the timber with both hands and let it take me
            along. The shore was out of sight now.</p>

        <p>You do not know how long you are in a river when the current moves swiftly. It seems a
            long time and it may be very short. The water was cold and in flood and many things
            passed that had been floated off the banks when the river rose. I was lucky to have a
            heavy timber to hold on to, and I lay in the icy water with my chin on the wood, holding
            as easily as I could with both hands. I was afraid of cramps and I hoped we would move
            toward the shore. We went down the river in a long curve. It was beginning to be light
            enough so I could see the bushes along the shore-line. There was a brush island ahead
            and the current moved toward the shore. I wondered if I should take off my boots and
            clothes and try to swim ashore, but decided not to. I had never thought of anything but
            that I would reach the shore some way, and I would be in a bad position if I landed
            barefoot. I had to get to Mestre some way.</p>
        <p>I watched the shore come close, then swing away, then come closer again. We were floating
            more slowly. The shore was very close now. I could see twigs on the willow bush. The
            timber swung slowly so that the bank was behind me and I knew we were in an eddy. We
            went slowly around. As I saw the bank again, very close now, I tried holding with one
            arm and kicking and swimming the timber toward the bank with the other, but I did not
            bring it any closer. I was afraid we would move out of the eddy and, holding with one
            hand, I drew up my feet so they were against the side of the timber and shoved hard
            toward the bank. I
            
            <pb n="243"/>
            
            could see the brush, but even with my momentum and swimming as hard as I could, the
            current was taking me away. I thought then I would drown because of my boots, but I
            thrashed and fought through the water, and when I looked up the bank was coming toward
            me, and I kept thrashing and swimming in a heavy-footed panic until I reached it. I hung
            to the willow branch and did not have strength to pull myself up but I knew I would not
            drown now. It had never occurred to me on the timber that I might drown. I felt hollow
            and sick in my stomach and chest from the effort, and I held to the branches and waited.
            When the sick feeling was gone I pulled into the willow bushes and rested again, my arms
            around some brush, holding tight with my hands to the branches. Then I crawled out,
            pushed on through the willows and onto the bank. It was halfdaylight and I saw no one. I
            lay flat on the bank and heard the river and the rain.</p>
        <p>After a while I got up and started along the bank. I knew there was no bridge across the
            river until Lati-sana. I thought I might be opposite San Vito. I began to think out what
            I should do. Ahead there was a ditch running into the river. I went toward it. So far I
            had seen no one and I sat down by some bushes along the bank of the ditch and took off
            my shoes and emptied them of water. I took off my coat, took my wallet with my papers
            and my money all wet in it out of the inside pocket and then wrung the coat out. I took
            off my trousers and wrung them too, then my shirt and underclothing. I slapped and
            rubbed myself and then dressed again. I had lost my cap.</p>
        <p>Before I put on my coat I cut the cloth stars off my sleeves and put them in the inside
            pocket with my money. My money was wet but was all right. I counted
            
            <pb n="244"/>
            
            it. There were three thousand and some lire. My clothes felt wet and clammy and I
            slapped my arms to keep the circulation going. I had woven underwear and I did not think
            I would catch cold if I kept moving. They had taken my pistol at the road and I put the
            holster under my coat. I had no cape and it was cold in the rain. I started up the bank
            of the canal. It was daylight and the country was wet, low and dismal looking. The
            fields were bare and wet; a long way away I could see a campanile rising out of the
            plain. I came up onto a road. Ahead I saw some troops coming down the road. I limped
            along the side of the road and they passed me and paid no attention to me. They were a
            machine-gun detachment going up toward the river. I went on down the road.</p>
        <p>That day I crossed the Venetian plain. It is a low level country and under the rain it is
            even flatter. Toward the sea there are salt marshes and very few roads. The roads all go
            along the river mouths to the sea and to cross the country you must go along the paths
            beside the canals. I was working across the country from the north to the south and had
            crossed two railway lines and many roads and finally I came out at the end of a path
            onto a railway line where it ran beside a marsh. It was the main line from Venice to
            Trieste, with a high solid embankment, a solid roadbed and double track. Down the tracks
            a way was a flag-station and I could see soldiers on guard. Up the line there was a
            bridge over a stream that flowed into the marsh. I could see a guard too at the bridge.
            Crossing the fields to the north I had seen a train pass on this railroad, visible a
            long way across the flat plain, and I thought a train might come from Portogruaro. I
            watched the guards and lay down on the embankment so that I
            
            <pb n="245"/>
            
            could see both ways along the track. The guard at the bridge walked a way up the line
            toward where I lay, then turned and went back toward the bridge. I lay, and was hungry,
            and waited for the train. The one I had seen was so long that the engine moved it very
            slowly and I was sure I could get aboard it. After I had almost given up hoping for one
            I saw a train coming. The engine, coming straight on, grew larger slowly. I looked at
            the guard at the bridge. He was walking on the near side of the bridge but on the other
            side of the tracks. That would put him out of sight when the train passed. I watched the
            engine come nearer. It was working hard. I could see there were many cars. I knew there
            would be guards on the train, and I tried to see where they were, but, keeping out of
            sight, I could not. The engine was almost to where I was lying. When it came opposite,
            working and puffing even on the level, and I saw the engineer pass, I stood up and
            stepped up close to the passing cars. If the guards were watching I was a less
            suspicious object standing beside the track. Several closed freight-cars passed. Then I
            saw a low open car of the sort they call gondolas coming, covered with canvas. I stood
            until it had almost passed, then jumped and caught the rear handrods and pulled up. I
            crawled down between the gondola and the shelter of the high freight-car behind. I did
            not think any one had seen me. I was holding to the hand-rods and crouching low, my feet
            on the coupling. We were almost opposite the bridge. I remembered the guard. As we
            passed him he looked at me. He was a boy and his helmet was too big for him. I stared at
            him contemptuously and he looked away. He thought I had something to do with the
            train.</p>
        <p>We were past. I saw him still looking uncomfortable, 
            
            <pb n="241"/>
            
            watching the other cars pass and I stooped to see how the canvas was fastened. It
            had grummets and was laced down at the edge with cord. I took out my knife, cut the cord
            and put my arm under. There were hard bulges under the canvas that tightened in the
            rain. I looked up and ahead. There was a guard on the freight-car ahead but he was
            looking forward. I let go of the hand-rails and ducked under the canvas. My forehead hit
            something that gave me a violent bump and I felt blood on my face but I crawled on in
            and lay flat. Then I turned around and fastened down the canvas.</p>
        <p>I was in under the canvas with guns. They smelled cleanly of oil and grease. I lay and
            listened to the rain on the canvas and the clicking of the car over the rails. There was
            a little light came through and I lay and looked at the guns. They had their canvas
            jackets on. I thought they must have been sent ahead from the third army. The bump on my
            forehead was swollen and I stopped the bleeding by lying still and letting it coagulate,
            then picked away the dried blood except over the cut. It was nothing. I had no
            handkerchief, but feeling with my fingers I washed away where the dried blood had been,
            with rain-water that dripped from the canvas, and wiped it clean with the sleeve of my
            coat. I did not want to look conspicuous. I knew I would have to get out before they got
            to Mestre because they would be taking care of these guns. They had no guns to lose or
            forget about. I was terrifically hungry.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXII</head>
        <p>Lying on the floor of the flat-car with the guns beside me under the canvas I was wet,
            cold and very hungry. Finally I rolled over and lay flat on my stomach with my head on
            my arms. My knee was stiff, but it had been very satisfactory. Valentini had done a fine
            job. I had done half the retreat on foot and swum part of the Tagliamento with his knee.
            It was his knee all right. The other knee was mine. Doctors did things to you and then
            it was not your body any more. The head was mine, and the inside of the belly. It was
            very hungry in there. I could feel it turn over on itself. The head was mine, but not to
            use, not to think with; only to remember and not too much remember.</p>
        <p>I could remember Catherine but I knew I would get crazy if I thought about her when I was
            not sure yet I would see her, so I would not think about her, only about her a little,
            only about her with the car going slowly and clickingly, and some light through the
            canvas and my lying with Catherine on the floor of the car. Hard as the floor of the car
            to lie not thinking only feeling, having been away too long, the clothes wet and the
            floor moving only a little each time and lonesome inside and alone with wet clothing and
            hard floor for a wife.</p>
        <p>You did not love the floor of a flat-car nor guns with canvas jackets and the smell of
            vaselined metal or a canvas that rain leaked through, although it is very fine under a
            canvas and pleasant with guns; but you loved some one else whom now you knew was not
            even to be pretended there; you seeing now very clearly and
            
            <pb n="248"/>
            
            coldly—-not so coldly as clearly and emptily. You saw emptily, lying on your stomach,
            having been present when one army moved back and another came forward. You had lost your
            cars and your men as a floorwalker loses the stock of his department in a fire. There
            was, however, no insurance. You were out of it now. You had no more obligation. If they
            shot floorwalkers after a fire in the department store because they spoke with an accent
            they had always had, then certainly the floorwalkers would not be expected to return
            when the store opened again for business. They might seek other employment; if there was
            any other employment and the police did not get them.</p>
        <p>Anger was washed away in the river along with any obligation. Although that ceased when
            the carabiniere put his hands on my collar. I would like to have had the uniform off
            although I did not care much about the outward forms. I had taken off the stars, but
            that was for convenience. It was no point of honor. I was not against them. I was
            through. I wished them all the luck. There were the good ones, and the brave ones, and
            the calm ones and the sensible ones, and they deserved it. But it was not my show any
            more and I wished this bloody train would get to Mestre and I would eat and stop
            thinking. I would have to stop.</p>
        <p>Piani would tell them they had shot me. They went through the pockets and took the papers
            of the people they shot. They would not have my papers. They might call me drowned. I
            wondered what they would hear in the States. Dead from wounds and other causes. Good
            Christ I was hungry. I wondered what had become of the priest at the mess. And Rinaldi.
            He was probably at Pordenone. If they had not gone further back. Well, I would never see
            him now. I would never see any of
            
            <pb n="249"/>
            
            them now. That life was over. I did not think he had syphilis. It was not a serious
            disease anyway if you took it in time, they said. But he would worry. I would worry too
            if I had it. Any one would worry.</p>
        <p>I was not made to think. I was made to eat. My God, yes. Eat and drink and sleep with
            Catherine. To-night maybe. No that was impossible. But tomorrow night, and a good meal
            and sheets and never going away again except together. Probably have to go damned
            quickly. She would go. I knew she would go. When would we go ? That was something to
            think about. It was getting dark. I lay and thought where we would go. There were many
            places.</p>
