                            <note resp="editors.xml#JOB"> The publication history of <hi
                                    rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels</hi> is complicated, and so too
                                is the publication history of this digital edition. Swift's first
                                publisher, Benjamin Motte, altered the text a bit to disguise some
                                of the harshest and most obvious episodes of satire against the
                                government. Most of these changes occur in Book I, where the
                                Lilliputian court was enough like the court culture of London in
                                1726 that readers would be quick to make obvious connections. Swift
                                does not seem to have been happy about the changes, and when the
                                opportunity came to revise the text back to what he intended in
                                1735, Swift took it, and restored some of the original jokes. This
                                is the edition that has most frequently been reprinted since the
                                1730s. Our digital edition is based on the version encoded for the
                                University of Virginia's E-Text Center in the 1990s and early 2000s.
                                It in turn is a transcription of the 1784 edition of Swift's
                                collected works as edited by Thomas Sheridan. Why this particular
                                edition was chosen by the E-Text Center is at this point beyond
                                reconstruction; one suspects that the facts that the edition was in
                                the public domain and close at hand played a significant part. But
                                the choice of base text explains why there are a few points where
                                the reading text produced here differs from the page images, which
                                are taken from a copy of the first, 1726 edition in the University

                    we have come to call <hi rend="italic">Gulliver’s Travels</hi> appeared, without
                    any advance notice or fanfare, on the shelves of London booksellers under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World</hi>.
                    The book identified its author as “Lemuel Gulliver, first a Surgeon, and then a
                    Captain of Several Ships." The name Jonathan Swift appeared nowhere on or in the
                    the book. Rather, a man named “Lemuel Gulliver" was was said to be the author,
                    his seeming authenticity proven by the fact that he was portrayed in a
                    frontispiece portrait that identified him as being fifty-eight years old and a
                    resident of Redriff, a village on the Thames river to the south east of London,
                    a logical place for a retired seaman to be living. <lb/>

                            satirist Persius, translates as something like "justice, uprightness,
                            and nobility of soul, in the sacred places of the mind, with a heart
                            filled with generous honor." University of Virginia

                    <lb/> There was of course no Lemuel Gulliver, and the travels depicted in the
                    book that follows his portrait are fictions as well. What Swift had discovered
                    in a way that no one else had before him was the ability of a new medium, here
                    the printed travel narrative, to create the impression of a reality that did not
                    exist. Part-satire, part-hoax, <hi rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels</hi> is
                    everywhere an exercise on understanding the relationship between reading and
                    knowing, an attack on the thoughtlessness of colonialist ideology, and a
                    profound contemplation on what it means to be a human being. <lb/> If there was
                    never a Lemuel Gulliver, there was no one else quite like Jonathan Swift,
                    either. He was born in Ireland in 1667 to a family that was a part of the wave
                    of English people who went there in that period, English Protestants who were
                    encouraged to emigrate and take positions in Irish institutions in order to bind
                    that island ever more tightly to English domination. Almost all biographical
                    accounts state that his father, also named Jonathan Swift, died seven months
                    before he was born. But there is no documentary evidence for that, or for his
                    parents’ marriage, the date of his father’s death, or even for Swift’s baptism.
                    Swift’s most recent biographer, Leo Damrosch, suggests that his real father may
                    have been Sir John Temple, a wealthy English nobleman who was living in Ireland
                    at the time and who knew Swift’s mother and her family. There is no way of
                    proving this, but it would explain some things, such as how Swift would become
                    the private secretary to William Temple, Sir John Temple’s son. Swift, without a
                    living father who could arrange such a post for him and having had an
                    undistinguished career as a student at Trinity College in Dublin, would not have
                    been an obvious choice, and he seems not to have met William Temple before he
                    began working for him. We will probably never be certain of the truth here. It
                    does not help that Swift cultivated a certain amount of mystery about his
                    private life. Although we know, for example, that he had intimate friendships
                    with several women, notably Esther Johnson (to whom he gave the name “Stella")
                    and Esther Vanhomrigh (who he referred to as Vanessa, a name that he invented),
                    the full nature of these relationships eluded, even mystified people who knew
                    both of them then, and frustrates us now. (Some people believed that Swift and
                    Esther Johnson had been secretly married; others thought that idea was
                    ridiculous.) Friends often found Swift to be witty and generous, but he could
                    also be demanding and moody. He suffered for much of his life from Meniere’s
                    disease, a disorder where fluid builds up in the inner ear. The condition
                    sometimes left him bedridden for days as he dealt with intense vertigo and
                    nausea. He eventually went deaf. Satirists are often outsiders, and it is not
                    hard to imagine how Swift might have felt himself to be an outsider to his
                    society, set apart by his birth and his health to be an ironic observer as often
                    as a full participant. <lb/>
                    <hi rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels</hi> was immediately a hit with readers,
                    and it did not take long for its real author to be identified, even though Swift
                    publicly stayed silent about his role for several years. The book was translated
                    into French and other European languages very early on; theatrical versions,
                    some with children playing the Lilliputians, were on the stage in London within
                    a few years. Gulliver's adventures, particularly his experiences with the small
                    but ruthless Lilliputians and the large but gentle Brobdignagians, have become
                    myths of the modern world, stories that everyone knows the general outlines of
                    even if they have never opened the book. But fully grasping what Swift was up to
                    has proven to be a challenge. Swift provided no gloss on his own work, and the
                    book defies an easy moral or satisfying conclusion. What, exactly, are we to
                    make of the Houyhnhnms, the intelligent horses of book IV who seem to have come
                    up with the kind of minimal, direct mode of governance that Swift seems
                    elsewhere to favor, but who are also able to contemplete genocide in casually
                    thinking of exterminating all the Yahoos? What do all of the encounters of Book
                    III, where Gulliver visits a series of miserable projectors of various kinds,
                    add up to, if anything? Who is this Gulliver, anyway, and what kind of character
                    are we dealing with? Swift plays with, defies, and undercuts our expectations
                    for what either a truthful travel narrative or a fictional story should be. <hi

                <p>The Author of of these Travels, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Lemuel Gulliver</hi>, is my
                    antient and intimate Friend; there is likewise some Relation between us by the
                    Mother's Side. About three Years ago, Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi>
                    growing weary of the Concourse of curious <pb n="V"
                        facs="https://lic-assets-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/Swift/pageImages/Gulliver-1-pV.jpg"
                    /> People coming to him at his House in <hi rend="italic">Redriff</hi>, made a
                    small Purchase of Land, with a convenient House, near <hi rend="italic"
                        >Newark</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Nottinghamshire</hi>, his Native Country;
                    where he now lives retired, yet in good Esteem among his Neighbours.</p>

                <p>Although Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi> was born in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nottinghamshire</hi>, where his Father dwelt, yet I have heard him say, his
                    Family came from <hi rend="italic">Oxfordshire</hi>; to confirm which, I have
                    observed in the Church-Yard at <hi rend="italic">Banbury</hi>, in that County,
                    several Tombs and Monuments of the <hi rend="italic">Gullivers.</hi></p>

                <p>Before he quitted <hi rend="italic">Redriff</hi>, he left the custody of the

                    /> dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully perused them three
                    Times: The Style is very plain and simple; and the only Fault I find is, that
                    the Author, after the Manner of Travellers, is a little too circumstantial.
                    There is an Air of Truth apparent through the Whole; and indeed, the Author was
                    so distinguished for his Veracity, that it became a sort of Proverb among his
                    Neighbours at <hi rend="italic">Redriff</hi>, when any one affirm'd a Thing, to
                    say, it was as true as if Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi> had spoke it.</p>

                <p>By the Advice of several worthy Persons, to whom, with the Author's Permission, I
                    communicated these Papers, I now venture to send them <pb n="VII"
                        facs="https://lic-assets-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/Swift/pageImages/Gulliver-1-pVII.jpg"

                    Entertainment to our young Noblemen, than the common Scribbles of Politicks and
                    Party.</p>

                <p>This Volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not made bold to
                    strike out innumerable Passages relating to the Winds and Tides, as well as to
                    the Variations and Bearings in the several Voyages; together with the minute
                    Descriptions of the Management of the Ship in Storms, in the Style of Sailors:
                    Likewise the Account of the Longitudes and Latitudes; wherein I have Reason to
                    apprehend that Mr. <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi> may be a little dissatisfied:
                    But I was resolved to fit the Work <pb n="VIII"

                    Ignorance in Sea-Affairs shall have led me to commit some Mistakes, I alone am
                    answerable for them: And if any Traveller hath a Curiosity to see the whole Work
                    at large, as it came from the Hand of the Author, I shall be ready to gratify
                    him.</p>

                <p>As for any further Particulars relating to the Author, the Reader will receive
                    Satisfaction from the first Pages of the Book.</p>

                        person. But he is in some senses more "real" than Gulliver. Richard Sympson
                        was the pseudonym that Swift used when he was negotiating for the
                        publication of this book with the London publisher Benjamin Motte; Swift
                        wanted to keep his identity secret, very likely out of concern that there
                        might be repercussions for the harshness of the satire against the
                        government. There had once been a real Richard Sympson; he worked with Swift
                        on a 1698 edition of the works of Sir Wiliam Temple, Swift's patron and (in
                        the belief of some), possibly his father. The fictionality of the man who
                        attests to the veracity of the fictional protagonist of the book, and who
                        goes so far as to claim that he has a manuscript of the book available for
                        skeptical readers to view, only deepens the reader's challenge in sorting
                        out what is real from what is fake.</note></p>

                            the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset
                            by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the
                            boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the
                            vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part,
                            I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide.
                            I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom: but when I was
                            almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my

                            down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder
                            than ever I remember to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, above
                            nine hours; for when I awakened, it was just daylight. I attempted to
                            rise, but was not able to stir for, as I happened to lie on my back, I
                            found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the

                            could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light
                            offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but in the posture
                            I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt
                            something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward
                            over my breast, <pb n="8" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p8.jpg"/> came
                            almost up to my chin; when bending my eyes downwards as much as I could,
                            I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow
                            and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime, I
                            felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following
                            the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that
                            they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards
                            told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon
                            the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured
                            so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes
                            by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, <hi

                            struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and
                            wrench out the pegs that fastened my <pb n="9"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p9.jpg"/> left arm to the ground; for,
                            by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to
                            bind me, and at the same time, with a violent pull, which gave me
                            excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair
                            on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two
                            inches. But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize
                            them; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and
                            after it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, <hi rend="italics">tolgo

                            whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and
                            some on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When
                            this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain,

                            method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, when,
                            my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for
                            the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the

                            same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me.
                            When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;
                            but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about

                            way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage
                            erected, about a foot and a half from the ground, capable of hold- <pb

                            whereof I understood not one syllable. But I should have mentioned, that
                            before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times

                            immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and cut the strings
                            that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of
                            turning it to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him
                            that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle age, and taller than

                            to sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it

                            have related (which was done in the night while I slept), that plenty of
                            meat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared to carry me to

                            generous. For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with

                        <p>These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to great
                            perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the
                            Emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several
                            machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great
                            weights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine
                            feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on
                            these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred
                            carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the
                            greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches
                            from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon
                            twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this
                            engine, which it seems set out in four hours after my landing. It was

                            something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had
                            the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up
                            into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an
                            officer in the Guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up
                            into my left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me
                            sneeze violently: whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three
                            weeks before I knew the cause of my awaking so suddenly. We made a long
                            march the remaining part of that day, and rested at night with five
                            hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows
                            and arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir. The next
                            morning at sunrise we continued our march, and arrived within two

                            was reckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the
                            town upon the same errand; and in spite of my guards, I believe there
                            could not be fewer than ten thousand, at several times, who mounted upon
                            my body by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued to
                            forbid it upon pain of death. When the workmen found it was impossible
                            for me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon
                            I rose up with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life. But
                            the noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk, are
                            not to be expressed. The chains that held my <pb n="24"

                            long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards
                            in a semi-circle; but, being fixed within four inches of the gate,
                            allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in the temple. </p>

                            occasion for fresh air. The Emperor was already descended from the
                            tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have

                            my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared,
                            to give me victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of
                            vehicle upon wheels till I could reach them. I took these vehicles, and
                            soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten
                            with liquor; each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls,
                            and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen
                            vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with
                            the rest. The Empress, and young Princes of the blood, of both sexes,
                            attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon
                            the accident that happened to the Emperor's horse, they alighted, and
                            came near his <pb n="29" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p29.jpg"/> person,

                            into the beholders. His features are strong and masculine, with an

                            malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as near
                            as they dare, and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows
                            at me as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very
                            narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the
                            ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to
                            deliver them bound into my hands, which some of his soldiers accordingly
                            did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends of their pikes into my
                            reach; I took them all in my right hand, put five of them into my coat
                            pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him
                            alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers
                            were in much pain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife: but
                            I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately
                            cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground,
                            and away he ran. I treated the <pb n="32"

                            taking them one by one out of my pocket, and I observed both the
                            soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my clemency,
                            which was represented very much to my advantage at court. </p>

                        <p>Towards night I with some difficulty got into my house, where I lay on
                            the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time
                            the Emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds
                            of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my
                            house; a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up the
                            breadth and length, and these were four double, which however kept me
                            but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of
                            smooth stone. By the same computation they provided me with sheets,
                            blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long
                            inured to hardships as I. </p>

                        <p>As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought
                            prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that
                            the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage and
                            household affairs must have ensued, if his Imperial Majesty had not
                            provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this
                            inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me should
                            return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house
                            without license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got
                            considerable fees. </p>

                        <p>In the meantime, the Emperor held frequent councils to debate what course
                            should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a particular
                            friend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to be as much in
                            the secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning
                            me. They ap- <pb n="34" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p34.jpg"/> prehended
                            my breaking loose, that my diet would be very expensive, and might cause
                            a famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me, or at least to shoot
                            me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon dispatch
                            me: but again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass
                            might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through
                            the whole kingdom. In the midst of these consultations, several officers
                            of the army went to the door of the great council chamber; and two of
                            them being admitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six criminals
                            above mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in the breast of
                            his Majesty and the whole board in my behalf, that an Imperial
                            Commission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine hundred yards

                            to attend him in his wars at their own expense. An establishment
                            was-also made of six hundred persons to be my domestics, who had
                            board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and tents built for them very
                            conveniently on each side of my door. It was likewise ordered, that
                            three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes after the fashion
                            of the country: that six of his Majesty's greatest scholars should be
                            employed to instruct me in their language: and, lastly, that the
                            Emperor's horses, and those of the nobility, and troops of guards,
                            should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to
                            me. All these orders were duly put in execution, and in about three
                            weeks I made a great progress in learning their language; during <pb
                                n="36" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p36.jpg"/> which time the Emperor
                            frequently honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my
                            masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some
                            sort; and the first words I learned were to express my desire that he
                            would please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees.
                            His answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a work of
                            time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that
                            first I must <hi rend="italics">lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon

                            acquire, by my patience and discreet behavior, the good opinion of
                            himself and his subjects. He desired I would not take it ill, if he gave
                            orders to certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might
                            carry about me several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if
                            they answered the bulk of so prodigious a person. I said, his Majesty
                                <pb n="37" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p37.jpg"/> should be
                            satisfied, for I was ready to strip myself, and turn out my pockets
                            before him. This I delivered part in words, and part in signs. He
                            replied, that by the laws of the kingdom I must be searched by two of
                            his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and
                            assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,
                            as to trust their persons in my hands: that whatever they took from me
                            should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate
                            which I would set upon them. I took up the two officers in my hands, put
                            them first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about
                            me, except my two <ref target="a055" corresp="n055">fobs</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"

                            chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we the searchers were not
                            able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and one of us stepping
                            into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part
                            whereof flying up to our faces, set us both sneezing for several times
                            together. In his right waistcoat pocket we found a prodigious bundle of

                            stances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied
                            with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly
                            conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm
                            of our hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of
                            which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the palisades before
                            your Majesty's court; wherewith we conjecture the Man-Mountain combs his
                            head, for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we found
                            it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket on
                            the right side of his middle cover (so I translate the word <hi
                                rend="italics">ranfu-lo</hi>, by which they meant my breeches) we
                            saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a
                            strong piece of timber, larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the
                            pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures,
                            which we know not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine
                                <pb n="40" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p40.jpg"/> of the same kind.
                            In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces
                            of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which
                            seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I
                            could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars
                            irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of
                            them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One of them was covered,
                            and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other, there
                            appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads.
                            Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by
                            our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might
                            be dangerous engines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that
                            in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of
                            these, and to cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which
                            we could not enter: these he <pb n="41"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p41.jpg"/> called his fobs; they were
                            two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but squeezed close
                            by the pressure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver
                            chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to
                            draw out whatever was fastened to that chain; which appeared to be a
                            globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal: for on the
                            transparent side we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and
                            thought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by that
                            lucid substance. He put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant
                            noise like that of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some
                            unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to
                            the latter opinion, because he assured us (if we understood him right,
                            for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did anything

                            serve him for the same use: we found therein several massy pieces of
                            yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value. </p>

                        <p>Having thus, in obedience to your Majesty's commands, diligently searched
                            all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide
                            of some prodigious animal; from which, on the left side, hung a sword of
                            the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch divided into
                            two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your Majesty's
                            subjects. In one of these cells were several globes or balls of a most
                            ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and requiring a strong
                            hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap of certain black
                            grains, but of no great bulk <pb n="43"

                        <p>When this inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me,
                            although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars. He
                            first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In the
                            meantime he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then
                            attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows
                            just ready to discharge: but I did not observe it, for my eyes were
                            wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar,
                            which, <pb n="44" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p44.jpg"/> although it had
                            got some rust by the sea water, was in most parts exceeding bright. I
                            did so, and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and
                            surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes
                            as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His Majesty, who is a
                            most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he
                            ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground as
                            gently as I could, about six foot from the end of my chain. The next
                            thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he meant
                            my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as I could,
                            expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with powder, which
                            by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape wetting in the sea (an
                            inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to
                            provide) I first cautioned the Emperor not to be afraid, and then I let
                            it off in the air. The astonishment here was much greater <pb n="45"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p45.jpg"/> than at the sight of my
                            scimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even
                            the Emperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in
                            some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had
                            done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him
                            that the former might be kept from the fire, for it would kindle with
                            the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air. I
                            likewise delivered up my watch, which the Emperor was very curious to
                            see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on
                            a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of ale.
                            He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of the
                            minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more
                            acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his learned men about him,
                            which were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my
                            repeating; although indeed <pb n="46"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p46.jpg"/> I could not very perfectly
                            understand them. I then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse
                            with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and
                            razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and journal-book.
                            My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in carriages to his
                            Majesty's stores; but the rest of my goods were returned me. </p>

                            court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to
                            conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I took all
                            possible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The natives
                            came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I would

                            not received a fall, and some of them two or three. I was assured that a

                            from the former, and such as I have not observed the least resemblance
                            of in any other country of the old or the new world. The Emperor holds a
                            stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the
                            candidates, advancing one by one, sometimes leap over the stick,
                            sometimes creep under it backwards and forwards several times, according
                            as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the Emperor holds one
                            end of the stick, and his first minister the other; sometimes the
                            minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs his part with most
                            agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded
                            with the blue-colored silk; the red is given to the next, and the green
                            to the third, which they all wear girt twice round about the middle; and
                            you see few great persons about this court who are not adorned with one
                            of these girdles. </p>

                        <p>The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily
                            led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet
                            without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand as I held it
                            on the ground, and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, upon a large courser,
                            took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a prodigious leap. I had
                            the good fortune to divert the Emperor one day after a very
                            extraordinary manner. I desired he would order several sticks two feet
                            high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon
                            his Majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions
                            accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many
                            carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I took nine of these sticks,
                            and fixing them firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet
                            and a half square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at
                            each corner, about <pb n="53" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p53.jpg"/> two
                            feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks
                            that stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as
                            the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks rising about five inches
                            higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side. When I had
                            finished my work, I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best
                            horse, twentyfour in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His
                            Majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one in my
                            hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise
                            them. As soon as they got into order, they divided into two parties,
                            performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,
                            fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in Short <ref target="a063"

                            discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their
                            horses from falling over the stage; and the Emperor was so much
                            delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be re- <pb n="54"

                            was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command; and, with
                            great difficulty, persuaded even the Empress herself to let me hold her
                            in her close chair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was
                            able to take a full view of the whole performance. It was my good
                            fortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments, only once
                            a fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his hoof
                            struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he overthrew
                            his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, and
                            covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other, in
                            the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in
                            the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt, and I repaired my
                            handkerchief as well as I could: however I would not trust to the
                            strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises. </p>

                        <p>About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was
                            entertaining the court with these kind of feats, there arrived an
                            express to inform his Majesty that some of his subjects riding near the
                            place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying
                            on the ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as wide as
                            his Majesty's bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man;
                            that it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay
                            on the grass without motion, and some of them had walked round it
                            several tunes: that by mounting upon each other's shoulders, they had
                            got to the top, which was flat and even, and stamping upon it they found
                            it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something
                            belonging to the Man-Mountain, and if his Majesty pleased, they would
                            undertake to bring it with only five horses. I presently knew what they
                            meant, and was glad at heart to re- <pb n="56"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p56.jpg"/> ceive this intelligence. It
                            seems upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in
                            such confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep,
                            my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was
                            rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I
                            came to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident
                            which I never observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I
                            entreated his Imperial Majesty to give orders it might be brought to me
                            as soon as possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and
                            the next day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good
                            condition; they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a
                            half of the edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were
                            tied by a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along
                            for above half an English mile: but the ground in that country being
                            extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected. </p>

                        <p>Two days after this adventure, the Emperor having ordered that part of
                            his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in a
                            readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner.
                            He desired I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as
                            I conveniently could. He then commanded his General (who was an old
                            experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in
                            close order, and march them under me, the foot by twentyfour <ref

                            advanced. This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand
                            horse. His Majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier
                            in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my
                            person; which, however, could not prevent some of the younger officers
                            from turning up their eyes as they passed under me. And, to confess the

                            were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded some

                            might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis, which the Emperor
                            easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the
                            inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice by proclamation of my
                            design to visit the town. The wall which encompassed it is two feet and

                            viewed them as I passed, are from <pb n="67"

                        <p>The Emperor's palace is in the centre of the city, where the two great
                            streets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet
                            distant from the buildings. I had his Majesty's permission to step over
                            this wall; and the space being so wide between that and the palace, I
                            could easily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of
                            forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal
                            apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely
                            difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but
                            eighteen inches high and seven inches wide. Now the buildings of the
                            outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me
                            to stride over them with <pb n="68" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p68.jpg"
                            /> out infinite damage to the pile, though the walls were strongly built
                            of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the same time the Emperor had a
                            great desire that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but this
                            I was not able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting
                            down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a
                            hundred yards distant from the city. Of these trees I made two stools,
                            each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The
                            people having received notice a second time, I went again through the
                            city to the palace, with my two stools in my hands. When I came to the
                            side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the other in
                            my hand: this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on the
                            space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide. I
                            then stepped over the buildings very conveniently from one stool to the
                            other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick. <pb n="69"

                            which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal
                            merits, as well as the many good offices he had done me during my

                            labor under two mighty evils; a violent faction at home, and the danger
                            of an invasion by a most potent enemy from abroad. As to the first, you
                            are to understand, that for above seventy moons past there have been two
                            struggling parties in this empire, under the names of <ref

                                noses. If we reverse the names "Tramecksan" and "Slamecksan" we find
                                that the former are "nas camard" (nas keemart) or snub-noses while

                                "nasus"-while "keemart" is a fairly accurate phonetic spelling of

                            themselves. It is alleged indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable
                            to our ancient constitution: but however this be, his Majesty has
                            determined to make use of only low heels in the administration of the
                            government, and all offices in the gift of the Crown, as you cannot but
                            observe; and particularly, that his Majesty's Imperial heels are lower
                            at least by a drurr than any of his court; (drurr is a measure about the
                            fourteenth part <pb n="72" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p72.jpg"/> of an

                            will neither eat nor drink, nor talk with each other. We compute the
                            Tramecksan, or High-Heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is
                            wholly on our side. We apprehend his Imperial Highness, the Heir to the
                            Crown, to have some tendency towards the High-Heels; at least we can
                            plainly discover one of his heels higher than the other, which gives him
                            a hobble in his gait. Now, in the midst of these <ref target="c0009"

                            that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon
                            the larger end: but his present Majesty's grandfather, while he was a
                            boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient
                            practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the Emperor his
                            father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great
                            penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs. The people so highly
                            resented this law, that our histories tell us there have been six
                            rebellions raised on that account; wherein one Emperor lost his life,

                            jerkin, about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I
                            could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards till I felt ground; I
                            arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so
                            frighted when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam
                            to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls. I
                            then took my tackling, and fastening a hook to a hole at the prow of
                            each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I was thus <pb
                                n="80" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p80.jpg"/> employed, the enemy
                            discharged several thousand arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and
                            face; and besides the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my
                            work. My greatest apprehension was for my eyes, which I should have
                            infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept
                            among other little necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket,
                            which, as I observed before, had escaped the Emperor's searchers. These
                            I took out and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus
                            armed went on boldly with my work in spite of the enemy's arrows, many
                            of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any
                            other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I now fastened
                            all the hooks, and taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a
                            ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so
                            that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the
                            cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely <pb n="81"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p81.jpg"/> cut with my knife the cables
                            that fastened the anchors, receiving above two hundred shots in my face
                            and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables to which my
                            hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy's
                            men-of-war after me. </p>

                        <p>The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,
                            were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the
                            cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or
                            fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving
                            in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of
                            grief and despair, that it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.
                            When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows
                            that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of the same ointment
                            that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I

                            waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal
                            port of Lilliput </p>

                        <p>The Emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issue of
                            this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a large
                            half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.
                            When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet in more
                            pain, because I was under water to my neck. The Emperor concluded me to
                            be drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching in a hostile
                            manner: but he was soon eased of his fears, for the channel growing
                            shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and
                            holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened, I cried

                        <p>His Majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all
                            the rest of his enemy's ships into his ports. And so unmeasurable is the
                            ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than
                            reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it
                            by a Viceroy; of destroying the Big-Endian exiles, and compelling that
                            people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain
                            the sole monarch of the whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from
                            this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well
                            as justice; and I plainly protested, that I would never be an instrument
                            of bringing a free and brave people into slavery. And when the matter
                            was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my

                            mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that
                            some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my
                            opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some

                        <p>About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from
                            Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace; which was soon concluded upon

                            advantageous to our Emperor, wherewith I shall not trouble the reader.
                            There were six ambassadors, with a train of about five hundred persons,
                            and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to the grandeur of their
                            master, and the importance of their business. When their treaty was
                            finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the credit I now
                            had, or at least appeared to have at court, their Excellencies, who were
                            privately told how much I had been their friend, made me a visit in
                            form. They began with many compliments upon my valor and generosity,
                            invited me to that kingdom in the Emperor their master's name, and
                            desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength, of which
                            they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them, but
                            shall not trouble the reader with the particulars. </p>

                        <p>When I had for some time entertained their Excellencies, to their

                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p86.jpg"/> would do me the honor to
                            present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master, the renown
                            of whose had so justly filled the whole world with admiration, and whose
                            royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country:
                            accordingly, the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor, I desired
                            his general license to wait on the Blefuscudian monarch, which he was
                            pleased to grant me, as I could plainly perceive, in a very cold manner;
                            but could not guess the reason, till I had a whisper from a certain
                            person, that Flimnap and Bolgolam had represented my intercourse with
                            those ambassadors as a mark of disaffection, from which I am sure my
                            heart was wholly free. And this was the first time I began to conceive
                            some imperfect idea of courts and ministers. </p>

                        <lb/>
                        <p>It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an
                            interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each
                            other as any two in <pb n="87" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p87.jpg"/>
                            Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the antiquity, beauty, and
                            energy of their own tongues, with an avowed contempt for that of their
                            neighbor; yet our Emperor, standing upon the advantage he had got by the
                            seizure of their fleet, obliged them to deliver their credentials, and
                            make their speech in the Lilliputian tongue. And it must be confessed,
                            that from the great intercourse of trade and commerce between both
                            realms, from the continual reception of exiles, which is mutual among
                            them, and from the custom in each empire to send their young nobility
                            and richer gentry to the other, in order to polish themselves by seeing
                            the world and understanding men and manners; there are few persons of
                            distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell in the maritime parts,
                            but what can hold conversation both tongues; as I found some weeks
                            after, when I went to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, which
                            in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice of <pb n="88"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p88.jpg"/> my enemies, proved a very
                            happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in its proper place. </p>
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I
                            recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked upon account of
                            their being too servile, neither could anything but an extreme necessity
                            have forced me to submit. But being now a Nardac, of the highest rank in
                            that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and the
                            Emperor (to do him justice) never once mentioned them to me. However, it
                            was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his Majesty, at least,
                            as I then thought, a most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with
                            the cries of many hundred people at my door; by which being suddenly
                            awaked, I was in some kind of terror. I heard the word burglum repeated
                            incessantly: several of the Emperor's court, making their way through
                            the crowd, entreated <pb n="89" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p89.jpg"/>
                            me to come immediately to the Palace, where her Imperial Majesty's
                            apartment was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honor, who fell
                            asleep while she was reading a romance. I got up in an instant; and
                            orders being given to clear the way before me, and it being likewise a
                            moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the Palace without trampling
                            on any of the people. I found they had already applied ladders to the
                            walls of the apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the
                            water was at some distance. These buckets were about the size of a large
                            thimble, and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they
                            could; but the flame was so violent that they did little good. I might
                            easily have stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind
                            me for haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed
                            wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would have
                            infallibly been burned down to the ground, if, by a presence <pb n="90"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p90.jpg"/> of mind, unusual to me, I had

                            and by laboring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate my urine;
                            which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper
                            places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the
                            rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting,

                            congratulate with the Emperor: because, although I had done a very
                            eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his Ma <pb n="91"

                            by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the realm,
                            it is capital in any person, of what quality soever, to make water
                            within the precincts of the palace. But I was a little comforted by a
                            message from his Majesty, that he would give orders to the Grand
                            Justiciary for passing my pardon in form; which, however, I could not
                            obtain. And I was privately assured, that the Empress, conceiving the
                            greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant side
                            of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings should never be

                        <p>Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which
                            all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in
                            practice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can there bring
                            sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country
                            for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to
                            his quality and condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money
                            out of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title
                            of Snilpall, or Legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend
                            to his posterity. And these people thought it a prodigious defect of
                            policy among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by
                            penalties without any mention of reward. It is upon this account that

                            fitted to some station or other, and that Providence never intended to
                            make the management of public affairs a mystery, to be comprehended only
                            by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born
                            in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to
                            be in every man's power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by
                            experience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service

                            decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their

                            turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a
                            table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal
                            park. Two hundred seamstresses were employed to make me shirts, <pb

                            and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which,
                            however, they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the
                            thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three
                            inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The seamstresses took my
                            measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at
                            my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end,
                            while the third measured the length of the cord with a rule an inch
                            long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a
                            mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the
                            wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old
                            shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they
                            fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same
                            manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking

                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p110.jpg"/> ner, by certain cords, as we
                            draw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was a good
                            mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their
                            mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a sirloin
                            so large, that I have been forced to make three bits of it; but this is
                            rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it bones and all, as in
                            our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and turkeys I usually
                            ate at a mouthful, and I must confess they far exceed ours. Of their
                            smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife. </p>

                        <p>One day his Imperial Majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired
                            that himself and his Royal Consort, with the young Princes of the blood
                            of both sexes, might have the happiness (as he was pleased to call it)
                            of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I placed them upon chairs
                            of state on my table, just <pb n="111"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p111.jpg"/> over against me, with their
                            guards about them. Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer, attended there
                            likewise with his <ref target="a092" corresp="n092">white

                            he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to
                            regard, but ate more than usual, in honor to my dear country, as well as
                            to fill the court with admiration. I have some private reasons to
                            believe, that this visit from his Majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of
                            doing me ill offices to his master. That minister had always been my
                            secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the
                            moroseness of his nature. He represented to the Emperor the low
                            condition of his treasury; that he was forced to take up money at great
                            discount; that <ref target="a093" corresp="n093">exchequer</ref><note resp="editors.xml#UVAstudstaff"

                        <lb/>
                        <p>I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who
                            was an innocent sufferer upon my account. The Treasurer took a fancy to
                            be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who
                            informed him that her Grace had taken a violent affection for my person;
                            and the court-scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to
                            my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood,
                            without any grounds, farther than that her Grace was pleased to treat me
                            with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship. I own she came often
                            to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the
                            coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some
                            particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the
                            court. And I still appeal to my servants round, whether <pb n="113"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p113.jpg"/> they at any time saw a coach
                            at my door without knowing what persons were in it. On those occasions,
                            when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to
                            the door; and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two
                            horses very carefully in my hands (for if there were six horses, the
                            postillion always unharnessed four) and place them on a table, where I
                            had fixed a moveable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent
                            accidents. And I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my
                            table full of company, while I sat in my chair leaning my face towards
                            them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen would gently
                            drive the others round my table. I have passed many an afternoon very
                            agreeably in these conversations. But I defy the Treasurer, or his two
                            informers (I will name them, and let them make their best of it)
                            Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me <hi

                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p114.jpg"/> dresal, who was sent by
                            express command of his Imperial Majesty, as I have before related. I
                            should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, if it had not been a
                            point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to
                            say nothing of my own; though I then had the honor to be a Nardac, which
                            the Treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows he is only a
                            Glumglum, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a Marquis is to a
                            Duke in England, although I allow he preceded me in right of his post.
                            These false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of,
                            by an accident not proper to mention, made Flimnap the Treasurer show
                            his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although
                            he were at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit
                            with him, and found my interest decline very fast with the Emperor
                            himself, who was indeed too much governed by that favorite. </p>

                            proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two
                            months forming against me. </p>

                        <p>I had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts, for which I was
                            unqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard and read
                            enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers; but never
                            expected to <pb n="116" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p116.jpg"/> have
                            found such terrible effects of them in so remote a country, governed, as
                            I thought, by very different maxims from those in Europe. </p>
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the Emperor of
                            Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very
                            serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his
                            Imperial Majesty) came to my house very privately at night in a close
                            chair, and without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen
                            were dismissed; I put the chair, with his Lordship in it, into my
                            coat-pocket: and giving orders to a trusty servant to say I was
                            indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed
                            the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by
                            it. After the common salutations were over, observing his Lordship's
                            countenance full of concern, and enquiring into the reason, he desired I
                            would hear <pb n="117" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p117.jpg"/> him with
                            patience in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life. His
                            speech was to the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he
                            left me. </p>

                        <p>You are to know, said he, that several Committees of Council have been
                            lately called in the most private manner on your account; and it is but
                            two days since his Majesty came to a full resolution. </p>

                        <p>The Treasurer was of the same opinion; he showed to what straits his

                            would soon grow insupportable: that the Secretary's expedient of putting

                            that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want
                            of sufficient food, you would grow weak and faint, and lose your
                            appetite, and consequently decay and consume in a few months; neither
                            would the stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should
                            become more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death, five
                            or six thousand of his Majesty's subjects might, in two or three days,
                            cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cartloads, and bury it
                            in distant parts to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a

                            the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman
                            was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. And as to myself, I
                            must confess, having never been designed for a courtier either by my
                            birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not
                            discover the lenity and favor of this sentence, but conceived it
                            (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes
                            thought of standing my trial, for although I could not deny the facts
                            alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some
                            extenuations. But having in my life perused many state trials, which I
                            ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct, I dared
                            not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a juncture, and
                            against such powerful enemies. Once I <pb n="130"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p130.jpg"/> was strongly bent upon
                            resistance, for while I had liberty, the whole strength of that empire
                            could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the
                            metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with horror, by
                            remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, the favors I received
                            from him, and the high title of Nardac he conferred upon me. Neither had
                            I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself that
                            his Majesty's present severities quitted me of all past obligations. </p>

                        <lb/>
                        <p>At last I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur
                            some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of my
                            eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want of
                            experience: because if I had then known the nature of princes and
                            ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their
                            methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should with
                            great <pb n="131" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p131.jpg"/> alacrity and
                            readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment. But hurried on by the
                            precipitancy of youth, and having his Imperial Majesty's license to pay
                            my attendance upon the Emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity,
                            before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend the
                            Secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning Blefuscu
                            pursuant to the leave I had got; and without waiting for an answer, I
                            went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I seized a large
                            man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up the anchors, I
                            stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my coverlet, which I
                            brought under my arm) into the vessel, and drawing it after me between
                            wading and swimming, arrived at the royal port of Blefuscu, where the
                            people had long expected me; they lent me two guides to direct me to the
                            capital city, which is of the same name. I held them in my hands till I
                            came within two hundred yards of the gate, and desired them to <pb
                                n="132" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p132.jpg"/> signify my arrival
                            to one of the secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his
                            Majesty's commands. I had an answer in about an hour, that his Majesty,
                            attended by the Royal Family, and great officers of the court, was
                            coming out to receive me. I advanced a hundred yards. The Emperor and
                            his train alighted from their horses, the Empress and ladies from their
                            coaches, and I did not perceive they were in any fright or concern. I
                            lay on the ground to kiss his Majesty's and the Empress's hand. I told
                            his Majesty that I had come according to my promise, and with the
                            license of the Emperor, my master, to have the honor of seeing so mighty
                            a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent with my
                            duty to my own prince; not mentioning a word of my disgrace, because I
                            had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose myself
                            wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I reasonably conceive
                            that the Emperor would discover the secret <pb n="133"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p133.jpg"/> while I was out of his

                        <p>Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast
                            coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off, in the sea,
                            something that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and
                            stockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object to
                            approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a
                            real boat, which I supposed might, by some tempest, have been driven
                            from a ship; whereupon I returned immediately towards the city, and <pb
                                n="135" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p135.jpg"/> desired his Imperial
                            Majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left after the
                            loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen under the command of his
                            Vice-Admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest
                            way to the coast where I first discovered the boat; I found the tide had
                            driven it still nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which
                            I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came
                            up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards of
                            the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The
                            seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the
                            forepart of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all
                            my labor to little purpose; for being out of my depth, I was not able to
                            work. In this necessity, I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat
                            forwards as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide
                            favoring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up my chin and
                            feel the <pb n="136" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p136.jpg"/> ground. I
                            rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and
                            so on till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now the most
                            laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which were stowed
                            in one of the ships, and fastening them first to the boat, and then to
                            nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being favorable, the
                            seamen towed, and I shoved till we arrived within forty yards of the
                            shore; and waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by
                            the assistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a
                            shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged. </p>

                        <p>I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under by the
                            help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat
                            to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people
                            appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so <pb n="137"
                                facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p137.jpg"/> prodigious a vessel. I told
                            the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way, to
                            carry me to some place from whence I might return into my native
                            country, and begged his Majesty's orders for getting materials to fit it
                            up, together with his license to depart; which, after some kind
                            expostulations, he was pleased to grant. </p>
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any
                            express relating to me from our Emperor to the court of Blefuscu. But I
                            was afterwards given privately to understand, that his Imperial Majesty,
                            never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was
                            only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the
                            license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would
                            return in a few days when that ceremony was ended. But he was at last in
                            pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the Treasurer, and
                            the rest of that <pb n="138" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p138.jpg"/>
                            cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles
                            against me. This envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of
                            Blefuscu the great lenity of his master, who was content to punish me no
                            farther than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled from justice, and
                            if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of my title of
                            Nardac, and declared a traitor. The envoy further added, that in order
                            to maintain the peace and amity between both empires, his master
                            expected, that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to have me sent
                            back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished as a traitor. </p>
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>The Emperor of Blefuscu having taken three days to consult, returned an
                            answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, that as for
                            sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that although I
                            had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for
                            many good offices I <pb n="139" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p139.jpg"/>
                            had done him in making the peace. That however both their Majesties
                            would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the
                            shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given order to fit up
                            with my own assistance and direction; and he hoped in a few weeks both
                            empires would be freed from so insupportable an incumbrance. </p>
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <p>With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch of
                            Blefuscu related to me all that had past, offering me at the same time
                            (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would
                            continue in his service; wherein although I believed him sincere, yet I
                            resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where
                            I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgements
                            for his favorable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused. I told him
                            that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way,
                            I was re- <pb n="140" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p140.jpg"/> solved to
                            venture myself in the ocean, rather than be an occasion of difference
                            between two such mighty monarchs. Neither did I find the Emperor at all
                            displeased; and I discovered by a certain accident, that he was very
                            glad of my resolution, and so were most of his ministers. </p>

                        <lb/>

                        <p>These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than
                            I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily
                            contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my
                            boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen fold of their
                            strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,
                            by twisting ten, twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of
                            theirs. A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by
                            the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I had the <ref target="a072"

                            the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very
                            graciously gave me: so did the Empress and young Princes of the blood.
                            His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs apiece,
                            together with his picture at full length, which I put immediately into

                                <pb n="142" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p142.jpg"/> sheep, with

                            hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six cows and two bulls
                            alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own
                            country, and propagate the breed. And to feed them on board, I had a
                            good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen
                            of the natives, but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means
                            permit; and besides a diligent search into my pockets, his Majesty
                            engaged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, although with
                            their own consent and desire. </p>

                            had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at
                            southeast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about half a
                            league to the northwest. I ad- <pb n="143"

                            anchor on the leeside of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I
                            then took some refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and I
                            conjecture at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours
                            after I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun
                            was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favorable, I steered the same
                            course that I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my
                            pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those
                            islands, which I had reason to believe lay to the northeast of Van
                            Diemen's Land. I discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next,
                            about three in the afternoon, when I had by my computation made
                            twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the
                            southeast; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no
                            answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made
                            all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then <pb n="144"

                            sails, and I came up with her between five and six in the evening,
                            September 26; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors. I
                            put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets, and got on board with all my
                            little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an English merchantman,
                            returning from Japan by the North and South Seas; the Captain, Mr. John
                            Biddle of Deptford, a very civil man, and an excellent sailor. We were
                            now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in
                            the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who
                            gave me a good character to the Captain. This gentleman treated me with
                            kindness, and desired I would let know what place I came from last, and
                            whither I was bound; <pb n="145" facs="pageImages/Gulliver-1-p145.jpg"/>

                            cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment,
                            clearly convinced him of my veracity. I then showed him the gold given
                            me by the Emperor of Blefuscu, together with his Majesty's picture at
                            full length, and some other rarities of that country. I gave him two

                            I got safe on shore, and set them grazing in a bowling-green at
                            Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily,

                            preserved them in so long a voyage, if the Captain had not allowed me

                            water, was their constant food. The short time I continued in England, I

the guns were all fast, and handed the mizzen. The ship lay very broad 
off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or 
hulling. We reefed the foresail and set him, we hauled aft the 
foresheet; the helm was hard aweather. The ship wore bravely. We 
belayed the fore-down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down 
the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things 
clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and 
dangerous. We hauled off upon the lanyard of the whipstaff, and helped 
the man at helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, 
because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the 
topmast 
<pb n="089"/> 
being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better 
way through the sea, seeing we had sea room. When the storm was 
over, we set foresail and mainsail, and brought the ship to: then we 
set the mizzen, main-topsail, and the fore-topsail. Our course was 
east northeast, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard 
tacks aboard; we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in 
the leebraces, and hauled forward by the weatherbowlings, and hauled 
them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen tack to 
windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.

ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the 
utmost distress for water. We thought it best to hold on the same

curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being 
full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing 
for life to the ship. I was going to halloo after them, although it 
had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking 
after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper 
than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start 
of him half a league, and the sea thereabouts being full of 
sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat. 
This I was afterwards told, for I dared not stay to see the issue of 
that adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and 
then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the 
country. I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised 
me was the length of the grass, which in those grounds that seemed 
to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to 
the inhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I 
walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it 
<pb n="091"/> 
being 
now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an 
hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a 
hedge of at least <ref target="c0030" corresp="n0030">one hundred and twenty feet high</ref><note xml:id="n0030" target="c0030">To give some reference as to the size of the hedge, the Americain football field is about 160 feet wide. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americain_football_field</note>, and the trees so 
lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude. There was 
a <ref target="c0031" corresp="n0031">stile</ref><note xml:id="n0031" target="c0031">A structure of steps that allows for passage over fences and hedges. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, 
and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was 
impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six feet 
high, and the upper stone above twenty. I was endeavoring to find some 
gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next 
field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I 
saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary 
spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as 
I could guess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and 
ran to hide myself in the corn, from whence I saw him at the top of 
the stile, looking back into the next field on the right hand, and 
heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking trumpet: 
but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly 
thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters like himself came 
towards him with reaping hooks in their hands, each hook about the 
size of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the 
first, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be. For upon some 
words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I 
kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to 
move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks 
<pb n="092"/> 
of the corn were 
sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze 
my body between them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I 
came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain 
and wind. Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the 
stalks were so interwoven that I could not creep through, and the 
beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced 
through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers 
not above a hundred yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil, 
and wholly overcome by grief and despair, I lay down between two 
ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I bemoaned my 
desolate widow, and fatherless children. I lamented my own folly and 
willfulness in attempting a second voyage against the advice of all my 
friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of mind I could 
not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me 
as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was 
able to draw an Imperial Fleet in my hand, and perform those other 
actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that 
empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested 
by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to 
appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian 
would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least of my 
misfortunes: for as human creatures are observed to be more savage and 
cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a 
morsel in the 
<pb n="093"/> 
mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians 
that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the 
right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise 
than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune to let the 
Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive 
with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that 
even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in 
some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery? 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with 
these reflections, when one of the reapers approaching within ten 
yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next 
step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two 
with his reaping hook. And therefore when he was again about to 
move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me. Whereupon the huge 
creature trod short, and looking round about under him for some 
time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground. He considered a 
while with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold on a small 
dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either 
to scratch or to bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a 
weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me up behind by the 
middle between his forefinger and thumb, and brought me within three 
yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly. I 
guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of 
mind, that I resolved not 
<pb n="094"/> 
to struggle in the least as he held me in 
the air about sixty feet from the ground, although he <ref target="c0032" corresp="n0032">grievously</ref><note xml:id="n0032" target="c0032">An adjective indicating a high level of severity. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> 
pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I 
ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my hands 
together in a <ref target="c0033" corresp="n0033">supplicating posture</ref><note xml:id="n0033" target="c0033">The act of begging (often used in a religious context) that is often marked by being down on one's knees with palms facing towards the sky. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and to speak some words in a 
humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in. For I 
apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, 
as we usually do any little hateful animal which we have a mind to 
destroy. But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with 
my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, 
much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he 
could not understand them. In the meantime I was not able to forbear 
groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides; 
letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the 
pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning; 
for, lifting up the <ref target="c0034" corresp="n0034">lappet</ref><note xml:id="n0034" target="c0034">Lapel or a flap in a garmet. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of his coat, he put me gently into it, 
and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial 
farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field. 
</p> <lb/>
    <lb/> <p>The farmer having (as I supposed by their talk) received such an 
account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small 
straw, about the size of a walking staff, and therewith lifted up 
the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of 
covering that nature had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a 
better view of my face. He called his <ref target="c0035" corresp="n0035">hinds</ref><note xml:id="n0035" target="c0035">Laborers or workers. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> about him, and asked 
them (as 
<pb n="095"/> 
I afterwards learned) whether they had ever seen in the 
fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly 
on the ground upon all four, but I got immediately up, and walked 
slowly backwards and forwards, to let those people see I had no intent 
to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to 
observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards 
the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and 
spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out 
of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the 
palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye, to see what it 
was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin 
(which he took out of his sleeve), but could make nothing of it. 
Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I 
took the purse, and opening it, poured all the gold into his palm. 
There were <ref target="c0036" corresp="n0036">six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each</ref><note xml:id="n0036" target="c0036">Whilst the Spanish pieces are most likely gold, the other coins are of lesser value. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, beside twenty 
or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger 
upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then 
another, but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made 
me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my 
pocket, which after offering to him several times, I thought it best 
to do. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature. 
He spoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears 
like that of a water mill, yet his words were articulate enough. 
<pb n="096"/> 
I 
answered as loud as I could, in several languages, and he often laid 
his ear within two yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly 
unintelligible to each other. He then sent his servants to their work, 
and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread 
it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground, with the palm 
upwards, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for 
it was not above a foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey, 
and for fear of falling, laid myself at length upon the 
handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the 
head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his 
house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she 
screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad 
or a spider. However, when she had a while seen my behavior, and how 
well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled, 
and by degrees grew extremely tender of me. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was 
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of an 
husbandman) in a dish of about twenty-four feet in diameter. The 
company were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old 
grandmother. When they sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance 
from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I 
was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge for 
fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, 
<pb n="097"/> 
then crumbled some 
bread on a <ref target="c0037" corresp="n0037">trencher</ref><note xml:id="n0037" target="c0037">A trencher is a flat piece of wood or a flat piece of bread that was used as a plate during the meal. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow, 
took out my knife and fork, and fell to eating, which gave them 
exceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small <ref target="c0038" corresp="n0038">dram cup</ref><note xml:id="n0038" target="c0038">A dram is a unit of measurement defined as about 3.5ml of fluid. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, 
which held about three gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up 
the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most 
respectful manner drank to her ladyship's health, expressing the words 
as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so 
heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise. This liquor 
tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master 
made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the 
table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader 
will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a 
crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt. I got up 
immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I 
took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners) and waving 
it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had gotten no mischief 
by my fall. But advancing forwards toward my master (as I shall 
henceforth call him), his youngest son who sat next him, an <ref target="c0039" corresp="n0039">arch</ref><note xml:id="n0039" target="c0039">Mischevious. Source: Oxford English Dictioanry</note> boy 
of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in 
the air, that I trembled every limb; but his father snatched me from 
him, and at the same time gave him such a <ref target="c0040" corresp="n0040">box on the left ear</ref><note xml:id="n0040" target="c0040">To box someone's ear means to slap them on the side of the head. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, as 
would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering 
him to be taken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe 
me a spite, and well 
<pb n="098"/> 
remembering how mischievous all children among us 
naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I 
fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to 
understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be 
pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again; 
whereupon I went to him and kissed his hand, which my master took, and 
made him stroke me gently with it. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>In the midst of dinner, my mistress' favorite cat leaped into her 
lap. I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers 
at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of 
this animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I 
computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her 
mistress was feeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this 
creature's countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at 
the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off and although my 
mistress held her fast for fear she might give a spring, and seize 
me in her talons. But it happened there was no danger; for the cat 
took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within 
three yards of her. And as I have been always told, and found true 
by experience in my travels, that flying, or discovering fear way to 
make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved in this dangerous juncture 
to show no manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or six 
times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard 
of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she 
<pb n="099"/> 
were more afraid of 
me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four 
came into the room, as it is usual in farmers' houses; one of which 
was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and a greyhound, 
somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a Child of a 
year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall 
that you might have heard from <ref target="c0041" corresp="n0041">London Bridge to Chelsea</ref><note xml:id="n0041" target="c0041">A journey of about five miles. Source: https://www.google.com/maps/</note>, after the

pure indulgence took me up, and put me towards the child, who 
presently seized me by the middle, and got my head in his mouth, where 
I roared so loud that the urchin was frightened, and let me drop; 
and I should infallibly have broken my neck if the mother had not held 
her apron under me. The nurse to quiet her babe made use of a 
rattle, which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, 
and fastened by a cable to the childs waist: but all in vain, so 
that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must 
confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her 
monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to 
give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape and color. It stood 
prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in 
circumference. The nipple was about half the size of my head, and 
the hue both of that and the <ref target="c0043" corresp="n0043">dug</ref><note xml:id="n0043" target="c0043">Nipple. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> so varified with spots, pimples and 
freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near 
sight of her, she 
<pb n="100"/> 
sitting down the more conveniently to give suck, and 
I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair skins of 
our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they 
are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a 
magnifying glass, where we find by experiment that the smoothest and 
whitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill colored. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those 
diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking 
upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate 
friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother 
when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view 
when I took him up in my hand and brought him close, which he 
confessed was at first a very shocking sight. He said he could 
discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were 
ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made 
up of several colors altogether disagreeable: although I must beg 
leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and 
country, and very little sunburned by all my travels. On the other 
side, <ref target="c0044" corresp="n0044">Discoursing</ref><note xml:id="n0044" target="c0044">Speaking of. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of the ladies in that Emperor's court, he used to 
tell me, one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a third too large 
a nose, nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this 
reflection was obvious enough; which however I could not forbear, lest 
the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed: 
for I must do them justice to say 
<pb n="101"/> 
they are a <ref target="c0045" corresp="n0045">comely</ref><note xml:id="n0045" target="c0045">Attractive or agreeable. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> race of people; 
and particularly the features of my master's countenance, although 
he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet, 
appeared very well proportioned. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When dinner was done, my master went out to his laborers, and as I 
could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife a strict charge 
to take care of me. I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, 
which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered 
me with a clean white handkerchief, larger and coarser than the 
mainsail of a man of war. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife 
and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awakened and found 
myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet 
wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My 
mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in. 
The bed was eight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities 
required me to get down; I dare not presume to call, and if I had, 
it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a 
distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family 
kept. While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the 
curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed. One of 
them came up almost to my face, 
<pb n="102"/> 
whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew 
out my <ref target="c0046" corresp="n0046">hanger</ref><note xml:id="n0046" target="c0046">A short sword. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to defend myself. These horrible animals had the 
boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his 
fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly 
before he could do me any mischief. He fell down at my feet, and the 
other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not 
without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and 
made the blood run trickling from him. After this exploit, I walked 
gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of 
spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but 
infinitely more nimble and fierce, so that if I had taken off my 
belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to 
pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it 
to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my 
stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still 
bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash 
cross the neck, I thoroughly dispatched it. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, 
ran and took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling and 
making other signs to show I was not hurt, whereat she was extremely 
rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of 
tongs, and throw it out of the window. Then she set me on a table, 
where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet 
of my coat, returned it to the scabbard. I was pressed to do more than 
one thing, which 
<pb n="103"/> 
another could not do for me, and therefore endeavored 
to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the 
floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to 
express myself farther than by pointing to the door, and bowing 
several times. The good woman with much difficulty at last perceived 
what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into 
the garden, where she set me down. I went on one side about two 
hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid 
myself between two leaves of sorrel and there discharged the 
necessities of nature. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and 
the like particulars, which however insignificant they may appear to 
grovelling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to 
enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of 
public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting 
this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have 
been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of 
learning or of style. But the whole scene of this voyage made so 
strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my 
memory, that in committing it to paper I did not omit one material 
circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several 
passages of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being 
censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travelers are often, perhaps 
not without justice, accused.

<p>My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of forward 
parts for her age, very dextrous at her needle, and skillful in 
dressing her baby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby's 
cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of 
a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of 
the rats. This was my bed all the time I stayed with those people, 
though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their 
language, and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy, 
that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she 
was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble 
when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts, 
and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed 
was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me 
with her own hands. She was likewise my school mistress to teach me 
the language: when I pointed to anything, she told me the name of it 
in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for 
whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above 
forty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of 
Grildrig, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole 
kingdom.

The word imports what the Latins call <hi rend="italics">nanunculus </hi>the Italians 
<hi rend="italics">homunceletino</hi>, and the English <hi rend="italics">mannikin</hi>. To her I chiefly owe my 
preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I 
called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse: and I should be guilty 
of great ingratitude if I omitted this honorable mention of her care 
and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power

</p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> <p>It now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that 
my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness 
of a splacknuck, but exactly shaped in every part like a human 
creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to 
speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several 
words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, 
would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the 
finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman's 
daughter of three years old. Another farmer who lived hard by, and was 
a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to 
inquire into the truth of this story. I was immediately produced, 
and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my 
hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master's guest, asked 
him in his own language how he did, and told him he was welcome, 
just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and 
dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold 
<pb n="106"/> 
me better, at which I 
could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like 
the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our people, who

which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of 
countenance. He had the character of a great <ref target="c0048" corresp="n0048">miser</ref><note xml:id="n0048" target="c0048">A miser is someone who is stingy and refues to spend their money even to the detriment of their quality of life. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and to my 
misfortune he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master 
to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town, which was 
half an hour's riding, about twenty-two miles from our house. I 
guessed there was some mischief contriving, when I observed my 
master and his friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing 
at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some 
of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, 
told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from 
her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell weeping 
with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would happen to me 
from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of 
my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also observed how modest 
I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honor, and what an 
indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for money as a public 
spectacle to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma 
had promised that Grildrig should be hers, but now she found they 
meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to 
give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, 
<pb n="107"/> 
sold it to a butcher. 
For my own part, I may truly affirm that I was less concerned than 
my nurse. I had a strong hope which never left me, that I should one 
day recover my liberty; and as to the <ref target="c0049" corresp="n0049">ignominy</ref><note xml:id="n0049" target="c0049">Shame. Source: Oxford English dictionary</note> of being carried 
about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in 
the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me 
as a reproach, if ever I should return to England; since the King of 
Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same 
distress. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master, <ref target="c0050" corresp="n0050">pusuant</ref><note xml:id="n0050" target="c0050">In accordance with. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box 
the next market day to the neighboring town, and took along with him 
his little daughter, my nurse, upon a <ref target="c0051" corresp="n0051">pillion</ref><note xml:id="n0051" target="c0051">A seat or bench behind the main drivers seat. Source Oxford English Dictionary</note> behind him. The box 
was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, 
and a few <ref target="c0052" corresp="n0052">gimlet</ref><note xml:id="n0052" target="c0052">A gimlet is a tool for boring holes into wood that keeps it from splitting. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful 
to put the quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on. 
However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though 
it were but of half an hour. For the horse went about forty feet at 
every step, and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the 
rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent. 
Our journey was somewhat further than from <ref target="c0053" corresp="n0053">London to St. Albans</ref><note xml:id="n0053" target="c0053">London is about twenty miles away from St. Albans. Source: https://www.google.com/maps/</note>. My 
master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after 
consulting a while with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary 
preparations, he hired the Grultrud, or crier, to give notice  
<pb n="108"/> 
through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the Sign of the 
Green Eagle, not so big as a splacknuck (an animal in that country 
very finely shaped, about six foot long) and in every part of the body 
resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform 
a hundred diverting tricks. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which 
might be near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a 
low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I 
should do. My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty 
people at a time to see me. I walked about on the table as the girl 
commanded: she asked me questions as far as she knew my 
understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud 
as I could. I turned about several times to the company, paid my 
humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other 
speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled with liquor, 
which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health. 
I drew out my hanger, and flourished it after the manner of fencers in 
England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I exercised as a 
pike, having learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown to 
twelve sets of company, and as often forced to go over again with 
the same <ref target="c0054" corresp="n0054">fopperies</ref><note xml:id="n0054" target="c0054">Foolishness. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, till I was half dead with weariness and 
<ref target="c0055" corresp="n0055">vexation</ref><note xml:id="n0055" target="c0055">Distressed. Source: Oxford English Dictionary </note>. For those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, 
that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My 
master for his own interest would not suffer any one to touch me 
except my nurse; and, to prevent danger, 
<pb n="109"/> 
benches were set around the 
table at such a distance as put me out of everybody's reach. 
However, an unlucky schoolboy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, 
which very narrowly missed me; otherwise, it came with so much 
violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for 
it was almost as large as a small <ref target="c0056" corresp="n0056">pumpion</ref><note xml:id="n0056" target="c0056">A pumpion is an older english word for pumpkin. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>: but I had the 
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the 
room. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next 
market day, and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient 
vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired 
with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours 
together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word. It 
was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I 
might have no rest at home, all the neighboring gentlemen from a 
hundred miles around, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my 
master's own house. There could not be fewer than thirty persons 
with their wives and children (for the country is very populous); 
and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me 
at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some 
time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday, 
which is their Sabbath) although I were not carried to the town. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to 
carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having 
therefore 
<pb n="110"/> 
provided himself with all things necessary for a long 
journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, 
and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my 
arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situated near the middle of 
that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house. 
My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried 
me on her lap in a box tied about her waist. The girl had lined it 
on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted 
underneath, furnished it with her baby's bed, provided me with linen 
and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could. 
We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with 
the luggage. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master's design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and 
to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village 
or person of quality's house where he might expect custom. We made 
easy journeys of not above <ref target="c0057" corresp="n0057">seven or eight score miles</ref><note xml:id="n0057" target="c0057">Score was once a term meaning twenty, similar to dozen meaning twelve. So thus seven or eight score miles would be 140 or 160 miles. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> a day: for 
Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with 
the trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own 
desire, to give me air and show me the country, but always held me 
fast by a leading string. We passed over five or six rivers many 
degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there 
was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We 
were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns 
besides many villages and private families. 
<pb n="111"/> 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>On the 26th day of October, we arrived at the metropolis, called 
in their language Lorbrulgrud, or Pride of the Universe. My master 
took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the 
royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact 
description of my person and parts. He hired a large room between 
three and four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in 
diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and <ref target="c0058" corresp="n0058">palisadoed</ref><note xml:id="n0058" target="c0058">Enclosed. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> it around 
three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling 
over. I was shown ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of 
all people. I could now speak the language tolerably well, and 
perfectly understood every word that was spoken to me. Besides, I 
had learned their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a 
sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor 
while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey. She 
carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a <ref target="c0059" corresp="n0059">Sanson's Atlas</ref><note xml:id="n0059" target="c0059">Nicholas Sanson was a French cartographer who created multiple atlas.

and interpreted the words.

quarrels with the Queen's dwarf.</hi></p></argument> 
<p>The frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very 
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the 
more unsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost 
reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I soon 
must die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While 
he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a Slardral, or 
Gentleman Usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me 
immediately thither for the diversion of the Queen and her ladies. 
Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange 
things of my beauty, behavior, and good sense. Her Majesty and those 
who attended her were beyond measure delighted with my demeanor. I 
fell on my knees, and begged the honor of kissing her Imperial foot; 
but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me 
(after I was set on a table) which I embraced in both my arms, and put 
the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some 
<pb n="113"/> 
general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as 
distinctly and in as few words as I could. She asked whether I would 
be content to live at court. I bowed down to the board of the table, 
and humbly answered, that I was my master's slave, but if I were at my 
own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her Majesty's 
service. She then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me 
at a good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was 
ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of 
gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the 
bigness of eight hundred <ref target="c0060" corresp="n0060">moidores</ref><note xml:id="n0060" target="c0060">Portugese gold coins. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; but, allowing for the proportion of 
all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold 
among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand <ref target="c0061" corresp="n0061">guineas</ref><note xml:id="n0061" target="c0061">British gold coins. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> would be 
in England. I then said to the Queen, since I was now her Majesty's 
most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favor, that 
Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and 
kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into 
her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor. Her Majesty 
agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer's consent, who was 
glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court: and the poor girl 
herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew, bidding 
me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I 
replied not a word, only making him a slight bow. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen observed my coldness, and when the farmer was gone out 
of the apartment, asked me 
<pb n="114"/> 
the reason. I made bold to tell her Majesty 
that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not 
dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance 
in his field; which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he 
had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he 
had now sold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious 
enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength. That my health 
was much impaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble 
every hour of the day, and that if my master had not thought my life 
in danger, her Majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap a 
bargain. But as I was out of all fear of being ill treated under the 
protection of so great and good an Empress, the Ornament of Nature, 
the Darling of the World, the Delight of her Subjects, the Phoenix 
of the Creation; so I hoped my late master's apprehensions would 
appear to be groundless, for I already found my spirits to revive by 
the influence of her most august presence. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great <ref target="c0062" corresp="n0062">improprieties</ref><note xml:id="n0062" target="c0062">Improper language. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> 
and hesitation; the latter part was altogether framed in the style 
peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from 
Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, 
was however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive 
an animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the King, 
who was then retired to his cabinet. His Majesty, a prince of much 
gravity, 
<pb n="115"/> 
and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first 
view, asked the Queen after a cold manner, how long it was since she 
grew fond of a splacknuck; for such it seems he took me to be, as I 
lay upon my breast in her Majesty's right hand. But this princess, who 
has an infinite deal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon 
the <ref target="c0063" corresp="n0063">scrutore</ref><note xml:id="n0063" target="c0063">A writing desk. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and commanded me to give his Majesty an account of 
myself, which I did in a very few words; and Glumdalclitch, who 
attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out 
of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my 
arrival at her father's house. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King, although he be as learned a person as any in his 
dominions, and had been educated in the study of philosophy, and 
particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and 
saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a 
piece of clockwork (which is in that country arrived to a very great 
perfection), contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard 
my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he 
could not conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied 
with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, 
but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, 
who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a higher price. 
Upon this imagination he put several other questions to me, and 
still received rational answers, no otherwise defective than by a 
foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with 
some rustic 
<pb n="116"/> 
phrases which I had learned at the farmer's house, and did 
not suit the polite style of a court. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>His Majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their 
weekly <ref target="c0064" corresp="n0064">waiting</ref><note xml:id="n0064" target="c0064">Attendance at court. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, according to the custom in that country. These 
gentlemen, after they had awhile examined my shape with much nicety, 
were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could 
not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was 
not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, 
or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed 
by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a 
carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and 
field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I 
should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other 
insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to <ref target="c0065" corresp="n0065">evince</ref><note xml:id="n0065" target="c0065">To reveal or indicate. Source Oxford English Dictionary</note> that 
I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that 
I might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected 
by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished, 
and that I had lived several years, as it was manifested from my 
beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying 
glass. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness 
<pb n="117"/> 
was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the Queen's favorite 
dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was nearly thirty feet 
high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only 
<hi rend="italics">relplum scalcath</hi>, which is interpreted literally, <ref target="c0067" corresp="n0067"><hi rend="italics">lusus naturae</hi></ref><note xml:id="n0067" target="c0067">"Lusus naturae" is Latin for freak-of-nature. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; a 
determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, 
whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby 
the followers of Artistotle endeavor in vain to disguise their 
ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all 
difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or 
two. I applied myself to the King, and assured his Majesty, that I 
came from a country which abounded with several millions of both 
sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses 
were all in proportion, and where by consequence I might be as able to 
defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his Majesty's 
subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those 
gentlemen's arguments. To this they only replied with a smile of 
contempt, saying that the farmer had instructed me very well in my 
lesson. The King, who had a much better understanding, dismissing 
his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not 
yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately, 
and then confronted him with me and the young girl, 
<pb n="118"/> 
his Majesty 
began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He 
desired the Queen to order that a particular care should be taken of 
me, and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her 
office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for 
each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court; 
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a 
maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but 
the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The Queen commanded 
her own cabinet maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a 
bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree 
upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my 
directions, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen 
feet square, and twelve high, with <ref target="c0068" corresp="n0068">sash windows</ref><note xml:id="n0068" target="c0068">A sash window is a window that has movable panels; these windows are still in popular use today. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, a door, and two 
closets, like a London bedchamber. The board that made the ceiling was 
to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready 
furnished by her Majesty's upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out 
every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at 
night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous 
for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs 
and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a 
cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as 
well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the 
carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt 
when I went in a coach. I desired 
<pb n="119"/> 
a lock for my door, to prevent 
rats and mice from coming in: the smith, after several attempts, 
made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a 
larger at the gate of a gentleman's house in England. I made a shift 
to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might 
lose it. The Queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be 
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English 
blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them. They were 
after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and 
partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine 
without me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty 
ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch 
stood upon a stool on the floor, near my table, to assist and take 
care of me. I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other 
necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the Queen, were not much 
bigger than what I have seen of the same kind in a London toy shop, 
for the furniture of a babyhouse: these my little nurse kept in her 
pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, 
always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the Queen but the 
two Princesses Royal, the elder sixteen years old, and the younger 
at that time thirteen and a month. Her Majesty used to put a bit of 
meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and 
her diversion was to see me eat in miniature. For the Queen (who had 
indeed 
<pb n="120"/> 
but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a 
dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some 
time a very nauseous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark, bones 
and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as 
that of a full grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth, as 
big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a 
hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set 
straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments 
were all in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried 
me out of curiosity to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a 
dozen of these enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I 
thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>It is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have before 
observed, was their Sabbath) the King and Queen, with the royal 
issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his Majesty, to 
whom I was now become a great favorite; and at these times my little 
chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt 
cellars. This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me, 
inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning 
of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able. His 
apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made 
very wise reflections and observations upon all I said. But, I 
confess, that after I had been a little too copious in talking of my 
own beloved country, 
<pb n="121"/> 
of our trade, and wars by sea and land, of our 
schisms in religion, and parties in the state, the prejudices of his 
education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up 
in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after an 
hearty fit of laughing, asked me whether I were <ref target="c0069" corresp="n0069">a Whig or a Tory</ref><note xml:id="n0069" target="c0069">Whigs and Tories were opposing factions in the British Parliament from the 1680's to the 1850's. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. Then 
turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white 
staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he 
observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be 
mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, said he, I dare 
engage, these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor,

</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so, upon 
mature thoughts, I began to doubt whether I were injured or not. 
For, after having been 
<pb n="122"/> 
accustomed several months to the sight and 
converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast 
my eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had first 
conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I 
had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their 
finery and best day clothes, acting their several parts in the most 
courtly manner, of strutting, and bowing, and <ref target="c0073" corresp="n0073">prating</ref><note xml:id="n0073" target="c0073">Talking foolishly. Source Oxford English Dictionary</note>, to say the 
truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as 
the King and his grandees did at me. Neither indeed could I forbear 
smiling at myself, when the Queen used to place me upon her hand 
towards a <ref target="c0074" corresp="n0074">looking glass</ref><note xml:id="n0074" target="c0074">A mirror. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, by which both our persons appeared before 
me in full view together! and there could be nothing more ridiculous 
than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled 
many degrees below my usual size. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the Queen's dwarf, who 
being of the lowest stature that was ever that country (for I verily 
think he was not thirty feet high) became insolent at seeing a 
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger 
and look big as he passed by me in the Queen's antechamber, while I 
was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the 
court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; 
against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, 
challenging him to wrestle, and such <ref target="c0075" corresp="n0075">repartees</ref><note xml:id="n0075" target="c0075">Witty remarks and conversations. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> as are usual in the 
mouths of court pages. One day at dinner this malicious little cub was  
<pb n="123"/> 
so nettled with something I had said to him, that raising himself upon 
the frame of her Majesty's chair, he took me up by the middle, as I 
was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a 
large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I 
fell over head and ears, and if I had not been a good swimmer, it 
might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant 
happened to be at the other end of the room, and the Queen was in such 
a fright that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my 
little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had 
swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; however, I 
received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was 
utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a farther 
punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream, into which he had 
thrown me; neither was he ever restored to favor; for soon after the 
Queen bestowed him to a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no 
more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what 
extremity such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>He had before served me a <ref target="c0076" corresp="n0076">scurvy</ref><note xml:id="n0076" target="c0076">Contemptible. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> trick, which set the Queen a 
laughing, although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and 
would have immediately <ref target="c0077" corresp="n0077">cashiered</ref><note xml:id="n0077" target="c0077">To dismiss from one's position. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> him, if I had not been so generous as 
to intercede. Her Majesty had taken a marrow bone upon her plate, 
and after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish 
erect as it stood before; the dwarf watching his opportunity, while 
Glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard, 
<pb n="124"/> 
mounted upon the stool she 
stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and 
squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above 
my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous 
figure. I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was 
become of me, for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes 
seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings 
and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf at my <ref target="c0078" corresp="n0078">entreaty</ref><note xml:id="n0078" target="c0078">Request. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> had no other 
punishment than a sound whipping. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was frequently <ref target="c0079" corresp="n0079">rallied</ref><note xml:id="n0079" target="c0079">"Good-humored" banter. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> by the Queen upon account of my 
fearfulness, and she used to ask me whether the people of my 
country were as great cowards as myself. The occasion was this. The 
kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious 
insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any 
rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing 
about my ears. They would sometimes alight upon my victuals; and leave 
their loathsome excrement or spawn behind, which to me was very 
visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics 
were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they 
would fix upon my nose or forehead, where they stung me to the 
quick, smelling very offensively, and I could easily trace that 
viscous matter, which our naturalists tell us enables those 
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much 
ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not 
forbear starting when they came on 
<pb n="125"/> 
my face. It was the common practice 
of the dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as 
schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on 
purpose to frighten me, and divert the Queen. My remedy was to cut 
them in pieces with my knife as they flew in the air, wherein my 
dexterity was much admired. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I remember one morning when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box 
upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I 
dared not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the 
window, as we do with cages in England) after I had lifted up one of 
my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for 
my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying 
into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes. 
Some of them seized my cake, and carried it <ref target="c0080" corresp="n0080">piecemeal</ref><note xml:id="n0080" target="c0080">Piece by piece. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> away, others 
flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and 
putting me in the utmost terror of their stings. However I had the 
courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air. I 
dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut 
my window. These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their 
stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles. I 
carefully preserved them all, and having since shown them with some 
other curiosities in several parts of Europe, upon my return to 
England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth 
for myself.

correcting modern maps. The King's palace, and  
some account of the metropolis. The Author's way  
of travelling. The chief temple described.</hi></p></argument> 
<p>I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, 
as far as I traveled in it, which was not above two thousand miles 
round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the Queen, whom I always 
attended, never went further when she accompanied the King in his 
progresses, and there stayed until his Majesty returned from viewing 
his frontiers. The whole extent of this prince's dominions reaches 
about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth. 
From whence I cannot but conclude that our geographers of Europe are 
in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and 
California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance 
of earth to <ref target="c0081" corresp="n0081">counterpoise</ref><note xml:id="n0081" target="c0081">Oppose. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> the great continent of <ref target="c0082" corresp="n0082">Tartary</ref><note xml:id="n0082" target="c0082">An old english term referencing an area of northern and central Asia. Source:Oxford English Dicitonary</note>; and therefore 
they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast 
tract of land to the northwest parts of America, wherein I shall be 
ready to lend them my assistance. 
</p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> <p>The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge 
of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable by 
reason of the volcanoes upon the tops. Neither do the most learned 
know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether 
they be inhabited at all. 
<pb n="127"/> 
On the three other sides it is bounded by 
the ocean. There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom, and those 
parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed 
rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with 
the smallest of their boats, so that these people are wholly 
excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world. But the large 
rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish, for they 
seldom get any from the sea because the sea fish are of the same 
size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching; 
whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and 
animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this 
continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by 
philosophers. However, now and then they take a whale that happens 
to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on 
heartily. These whales I have known so large that a man could hardly 
carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes for curiosity they are 
brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud: I saw one of them in a dish at 
the King's table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe 
he was fond of it; for I think indeed the bigness disgusted him, 
although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, 
near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To 
satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe 
Lorbrulgrud. This city stands upon almost two equal parts on each side 
the river that passes through. It contains 
<pb n="128"/> 
above eighty thousand 
houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length 
three glonglungs (which make about fifty-four English miles) and two 
and a half in breadth, as I measured it myself in the royal map made 
by the King's order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me, 
and extended a hundred feet; I paced the diameter and circumference 
several times barefoot, and computing by the scale, measured it pretty 
exactly. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King's palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of building 
about seven miles around: the chief rooms are generally two hundred 
and forty feet high, and broad and long proportion. A coach was 
allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took 
her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of 
the party, carried in my box; although the girl at my own desire would 
often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more 
conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the 
streets. I reckoned our coach to be about a square of <ref target="c0083" corresp="n0083">Westminster Hall</ref><note xml:id="n0083" target="c0083">A meeting place for the two houses of parliament. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, but not altogether so high; however, I cannot be very exact. One 
day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where 
the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the 
coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacles that ever an English 
eye beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled 
to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could 
have easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow 
with a <ref target="c0084" corresp="n0084">wen</ref><note xml:id="n0084" target="c0084">A cyst. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> in his neck, larger than five <ref target="c0085" corresp="n0085">wool-packs</ref><note xml:id="n0085" target="c0085">Bags of wool bagged for sale. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and another 
<pb n="129"/> 
with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the 
most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes. I 
could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much 
better than those of an European <ref target="c0086" corresp="n0086">louse</ref><note xml:id="n0086" target="c0086">A parasitic insect. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> through a microscope, and their

ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of 
them, if I had proper instruments (which I unluckily left behind me in 
the shop) although indeed the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly 
turned my stomach. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the Queen 
ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet 
square, and ten high, for the convenience of traveling, because the 
other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome 
in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the 
whole contrivance. This traveling closet was an exact square with a 
window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was 
latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long 
journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong 
staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I 
had a mind to be on horseback, put in a leathern belt, and buckled 
it about his waist. This was always the office of some grave trusty 
servant in whom I could confide, whether I attended the King and Queen 
in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a 
visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when 
<pb n="130"/> 
Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order: for I soon began to be 
known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon 
account of their Majesties' favor, than any merit of my own. In 
journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback 
would buckle my box, and place it on a cushion before him; and there I 
had a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three 
windows. I had in this closet a field bed and a hung from the ceiling, 
two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent 
being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And 
having been long used to sea voyages, those motions, although 
sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my traveling 
closet, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open <ref target="c0088" corresp="n0088">sedan</ref><note xml:id="n0088" target="c0088">A vehicle. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, 
after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by 
two others in the Queen's <ref target="c0089" corresp="n0089">livery</ref><note xml:id="n0089" target="c0089">Dress or uniform. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. The people who had often heard of 
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was 
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her 
hand that I might be more conveniently seen. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the 
tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom. 
Accordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly 
say I came back disappointed; for height is not above three thousand 
feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which 
allowing for 
<pb n="131"/> 
the difference between the size of those people and us in 
Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in 
proportion (if I rightly remember) to <ref target="c0090" corresp="n0090">Salisbury steeple</ref><note xml:id="n0090" target="c0090">The steeple at the Salisbury Cathedral is 404 feet tall. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbuy_Cathedral</note>. But, not to 
detract from a nation to which during my life I shall acknowledge 
myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous 
tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength. For the 
walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each 
is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of 
gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life, placed in 
their several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down 
from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and 
found it exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch 
wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket 
to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as 
children at her age usually are. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King's kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and 
about six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten 
yards as the <ref target="c0091" corresp="n0091">cupola at St. Paul's</ref><note xml:id="n0091" target="c0091">The diameter of the cupola, or dome of St. Paul's Cathedral is 112 feet. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral</note>; for I measured the latter on 
purpose after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate, 
the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the 
spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly 
believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged 
a little, as travelers are often suspected to do. To avoid which 
censure, I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that 
if this treatise should happen to be translated into the 
<pb n="132"/> 
language of 
Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom) and 
transmitted thither, the King and his people would have reason to 
complain that I had done them an injury by a false and diminutive 
representation. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>His Majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: 
they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he 
goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended for state by a militia 
guard of five hundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most 
splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his 
army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.

<p>I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness 
had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents, 
some of which I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried 
me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would 
sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand, or set me down to 
walk. I remember, before the dwarf left the Queen, he followed us 
one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and 
I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show 
my wit by a silly allusion between him and the trees, 
<pb n="133"/> 
which happens to 
hold in their language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious 
rogue watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of 
them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of 
them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; 
one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me 
down flat on my face, but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf 
was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Another day Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert 
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the 
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was 
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground: and when I was 
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if 
I had been pelted with tennis balls; however, I made a shift to 
creep on all fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the 
lee side of a border of lemon thyme, but so bruised from head to 
foot that I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to 
be wondered at, because nature in that country observing the same 
proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen 
hundred times as large as one in Europe, which I can assert upon 
experience, having been so curious to weigh and measure them. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, 
when my little nurse believing 
<pb n="134"/> 
she had put me in a secure place, (which 
I often entreated her to do, that might enjoy my own thoughts) and 
having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went 
to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of 
her acquaintance. While she was absent and out of hearing, a small 
white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners, having got by 
accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I 
lay. The dog following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in 
his mouth, ran straight to his master, wagging his tail, and set me 
gently on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that 
I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even 
tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a 
great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright. He gently took me 
up in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed 
and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I 
came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who by this 
time had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel 
agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called: she 
severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing 
was hushed up, and never known at court; for the girl was afraid of 
the Queen's anger, and truly as to myself, I thought it would not be 
for my reputation that such a story should go about. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust 
me abroad for the future out 
<pb n="135"/> 
of her sight. I had been long afraid of 
this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little 
unlucky adventures that happened in those times when I was left by 
myself. Once a kite hovering over the garden made a swoop at me, and 
if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick 
<ref target="c0093" corresp="n0093">espalier</ref><note xml:id="n0093" target="c0093">A shrub. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons. 
Another time walking to the top of a fresh molehill, I fell to my neck 
in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth, and 
coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for 
spoiling my clothes. I likewise broke my right shin against the 
shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking 
alone, and thinking on poor England. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified, to observe 
in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at 
all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard's distance, 
looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and 
security as if no creature at all were near them. I remember a 
thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a 
piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. 
When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn 
against me, endeavoring to pick my fingers, which I dared not 
venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned 
to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day I took 
a thick <ref target="c0094" corresp="n0094">cudgel</ref><note xml:id="n0094" target="c0094">A stick used for beating, similar to a club. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and threw it with all my strength so luckily at a 
<ref target="c0095" corresp="n0095">linnet</ref><note xml:id="n0095" target="c0095">A type of finch. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_linnet</note> that I knocked him down, and seizing 
<pb n="136"/> 
him by the neck with 
both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird, 
who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave me so many boxes 
with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at 
arm's length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty 
times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by one of our 
servants, who wrung off the bird's neck, and I had him next day for 
dinner, by the Queen's command. This as near as I can remember, to 
be somewhat larger than an English swan. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Maids of Honor often invited Glumdalclitch to their 
apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on 
purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would 
often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in 
their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted; because, to say the 
truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not 
mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for 
whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was 
more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those 
illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to 
each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England. 
And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more 
supportable than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately 
swooned away. I cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in 
Lilliput took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal 
of exercise, to 
<pb n="137"/> 
complain of a strong smell about me, although I am 
as little faulty that way as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty 
of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this 
people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the Queen 
my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet 
as those of any lady in England. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>That which gave me most uneasiness among these Maids of Honor, 
when my nurse carried me to visit them, was to see them use me without 
any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of 
consequence. For they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on 
their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet 
directly before their naked bodies, which, I am sure, to me was very 
far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other 
emotions than those of horror and disgust. Their skins appeared so 
coarse and uneven, so variously colored, when I saw them near, with 
a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from 
it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing further concerning the 
rest of their persons. Neither did they at all <ref target="c0096" corresp="n0096">scruple</ref><note xml:id="n0096" target="c0096">Hesitate. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, while I was 
by, to discharge what they had drunk, to the quantity of at least 
two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tons. The 
handsomest among these Maids of Honor, a pleasant frolicsome girl of 
sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, 
with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not 
being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I 
entreated Glumdalclitch 
<pb n="138"/> 
to contrive some excuse for not seeing that 
young lady any more. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>One day a young gentleman, who was a nephew to my nurse's governess, 
came and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man who 
had murdered one of that gentleman's intimate acquaintance. 
Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against 
her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted; and as for 
myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my 
curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be 
extraordinary. The <ref target="c0097" corresp="n0097">malefactor</ref><note xml:id="n0097" target="n0097">A criminal. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold 
erected for the purpose, and his head cut off at a blow with a sword 
of about forty foot long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a 
prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great

the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce, as 
made me start, although I were at least half an English mile distant. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages, and 
took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me 
whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a 
little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health. I 
answered that I understood both very well. For, although my proper 
employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet upon a 
pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see 
how this could be 
<pb n="139"/> 
done in their country, where the smallest <ref target="c0099" corresp="n0099">wherry</ref><note xml:id="n0099" target="c0099">A rowboat for carrying passengers. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was 
equal to a first-rate man of war among us, and such a boat as I 
could manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her Majesty 
said, if I would contrive a boat, her own <ref target="c0100" corresp="n0100">joiner</ref><note xml:id="n0100" target="c0100">A wood craftsman. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> should make it, and 
she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an 
ingenious workman, and by my instructions in ten days finished a 
pleasure boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight 
Europeans. When it was finished, the Queen was so delighted, that 
she ran with it in her lap to the King, who ordered it to be put in 
a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial; where I could 
not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the 
Queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner 
to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and 
eight deep; which being well pitched to prevent leaking, was placed on 
the floor along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a 
cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale, 
and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often 
used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the Queen and her 
ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and 
agility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was 
only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and 
when they were weary, some of the pages would blow my sail forward 
with their breath, while I showed my art steering starboard or 
larboard as I pleased. When I had 
<pb n="140"/> 
done, Glumdalclitch always carried 
my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>In this exercise I once met an accident which had like to have 
cost me my life. For one of the pages having put my boat into the 
trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously 
lifted me up to place me in the boat, but I happened to slip through 
her fingers, and should have infallibly fallen down forty feet upon 
the floor, if by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been 
stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman's 
stomacher; the head of the pin passed between my shirt and the 
waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air 
till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my 
trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless to let a huge 
frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay 
concealed till I was put into my boat, but then seeking a resting 
place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was 
forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent 
overturning. When the frog got in, it hopped at once half the length 
of the boat, and then over my head, backwards and forwards, daubing my 
face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its 
features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be 
conceived. However, I desired Glumdaclitch to let me deal with it 
alone. I 
<pb n="141"/> 
banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last 
forced it to leap out of the boat. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from 
a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. 
Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere 
upon business or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet 
window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger 
box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and 
conveniency. As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard 
something bounce in at the closet window, and skip about from one side 
to the other; whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured 
to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and then I saw this 
frolicsome animal, frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he 
came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and 
curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to the 
farther corner of my room, or box, but the monkey looking in at 
every side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted presence of 
mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done. 
After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last 
espied me, and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat 
does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to 
avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made 
of that country cloth, was very thick and strong) and dragged me 
out. He took me up in his right forefoot, and held me as a nurse 
does a child she is going to suckle, 
<pb n="142"/> 
just as I have seen the same sort 
of creature do with a kitten in Europe: and when I offered to 
struggle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to 
submit. I have good to believe that he took me for a young one of 
his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his 
other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the 
closet door, as if somebody were opening it; whereupon he suddenly 
leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the 
leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the 
fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I 
heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me 
out. The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace 
was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was 
seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, 
holding me like a baby in one of his fore-paws, and feeding me with 
the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out 
of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not 
eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; 
neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for without 
question the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself. Some 
of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but 
this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably my brains had 
been dashed out. 
<pb n="143"/> 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men, which 
the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not 
being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on 
a ridge tile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time three 
hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down 
by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over 
and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my 
nurse's footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches 
pocket, brought me down safe. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed 
down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth 
with a small needle, and then I fell to vomiting, which gave me 
great relief. Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the 
squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep 
my bed a fortnight. The King, Queen, and all the court, sent every day 
to inquire after my health, and her Majesty made me several visits 
during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an order made that no 
such animal should be kept about the palace. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When I attended the King after my recovery, to return him thanks for 
his favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this 
adventure. He asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while 
I lay in the monkey's paw, how I liked the victuals he gave me, his 
manner of feeding, and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened 
my stomach. He desired to know what I would have 
<pb n="144"/> 
done upon such an 
occasion in my own country. I told his Majesty that in Europe we had no 
monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosities from other 
places, and so small that I could deal with a dozen of them 
together, if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous 
animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an 
elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make 
use of my hanger (looking fiercely and clapping my hand upon the 
hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I 
should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to 
withdraw it with more haste than he put it in. This I delivered in a 
firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be 
called in question. However, my speech produced nothing else besides a 
loud laughter, which all the respect due to his Majesty from those 
about him could not make them contain. This made me reflect how vain 
an attempt it is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among those 
who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And 
yet I have seen the moral of my own behavior very frequent in 
England since my return, where a little contemptible varlet, without 
the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall 
presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with 
the greatest persons of the kingdom. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story; and 
Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to 
inform 
<pb n="145"/> 
the Queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought 
would be diverting to her Majesty. The girl, who had been out of 
order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour's 
distance, or thirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach 
near a small footpath in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my 
traveling box, I went out of it to walk. There was a cow dung in the 
path, and I must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over 
it. I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself 
just in the middle up to my knees. I waded through with some 
difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could 
with his handkerchief; for I was filthily bemired, and my nurse 
confined me to my box till we returned home; where the Queen was 
soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about 
the court, so that all the mirth, for some days, was at my expense.

often seen him under the barber's hand, which indeed was at first very 
terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an 
ordinary scythe. His Majesty, according to the custom of the 
country, was only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the 
barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked 
forty or 
<pb n="146"/> 
fifty of the strongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of 
fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in 
it at equal distance with as small a needle as I could get from 
Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and 
sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very 
tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much 
broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know 
any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to 
make me another. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>And this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of 
my leisure hours. I desired the Queen's woman to save for me the 
combings of her Majesty's hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity, 
and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received 
general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two 
chair frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and then to bore 
little holes with a fine <ref target="c0102" corresp="n0102">awl</ref><note xml:id="n0102" target="c0102">A pointed tool for making holes. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> round those parts where I designed the 
backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I 
could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England. 
When they were finished, I made a present of them to her Majesty, 
who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, 
as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them. The 
Queen would have had me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely 
refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die a thousand deaths 
than place a dishonorable part of my body on those precious hairs that 
once adorned her Majesty's 
<pb n="147"/> 
head. Of these hairs (as I had always a 
mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse about five feet 
long, with her Majesty's name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave 
to Glumdalclitch, by the Queen's consent. To say the truth, it was 
more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of 
the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little 
toys that girls are fond of. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to 
which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear 
them; but the noise was so great, that I could hardly distinguish 
the tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal 
army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal 
it. My practice was to have my box removed from the places where the
