When it was first published in 1726, the book that we have come to call <hi rend="italics">Gulliver’s Travels</hi> appeared, without any advance notice or fanfare, on the shelves of London booksellers under the title <hi rend="italics">Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World</hi>, with the author identified as “Lemuel Gulliver, first a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships." The name Jonathan Swift appeared nowhere on the book; rather, “Lemuel Gulliver" was portrayed in a frontispiece portrait that identified him as being fifty-eight years old and a resident of Redriff, a village on the Thames river to the south east of London, a logical place for a retired seaman to be living.

There was no one quite like the book’s “real" author, Jonathan Swift, either. He was born in Ireland in 1667 to a family that was a part of the wave of English people who went there in that period, English Protestants who were encouraged to emigrate and take positions in Irish institutions in order to bind that island ever more tightly to English domination. Almost all biographical accounts state that his father, also named Jonathan Swift, died seven months before he was born. But there is no documentary evidence for that, or for his parents’ marriage, the date of his father’s death, or even for Swift’s baptism. Swift’s most recent biographer, Leo Damrosch, suggests that his real father may have been Sir John Temple, a wealthy English nobleman who was living in Ireland at the time and who knew Swift’s mother and her family. There is no way of proving this, but it would explain some things, such as how Swift would become the private secretary to William Temple, Sir John Temple’s son. Swift, without a living father who could arrange such a post for him and having had an undistinguished career as a student at Trinity College in Dublin, would not have been an obvious choice, and he seems not to have met William Temple before he began working for him. We will probably never be certain of the truth here, but it is clear that Swift cultivated a certain amount of mystery about his private life. Although we know, for example, that he had intimate friendships with several women, notably Esther Johnson (to whom he gave the name “Stella") and Esther Vanhomrigh (who he referred to as Vanessa, a name that he invented), the full nature of these relationships eluded, even mystified people then, and frustrates us now. (Some people believed that Swift and Stella had been secretly married; others thought that idea was ridiculous.) Friends found him witty and generous, but he could also be demanding and moody. He suffered for much of his life from Meniere’s disease, a disorder where fluid builds up in the inner ear. The condition sometimes left him bedridden for days as he dealt with intense vertigo and nausea; he eventually went deaf. Satirists are often outsiders, and it is not hard to imagine how Swift might have felt himself to be an outsider to his society, set apart by his birth and his health to be an ironic observer as often as a full participant.

            <p>Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended, by my good master Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannell commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage or two into the <ref target="a006" corresp="n006">Levant</ref> <note xml:id="n006" target="a006"> The Levant, depicted here, <figure><media mimeType="image/jpg" url="http://virginia-anthology.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Levant.jpg"/></figure>is composed of the countries on the Eastern Mediterranean Sea spanning from approximately Greece to Egypt Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and some other parts. When I came back, I resolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged me, and by him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a small house in the <ref target="a007" corresp="n007">Old Jury</ref> <note xml:id="n007" target="a007">The Old Jury or the Old Jewry is a street in London, and is historically a main financial and commercial district in England Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; and being advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, <ref target="a008" corresp="n008">hosier</ref> <note xml:id="n008" target="a008"> A hosier is a maker of women's panty hose, stockings, or tights Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a <ref target="a009" corresp="n009">portion</ref> <note xml:id="n009" target="a009"> Portion refers to his dowry he received during their marriage.

 <p>But, my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having 
     therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I determined to go again to sea.

<p>The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I removed from the Old jury to Fetter-Lane, and from thence to Wapping 
hoping to get business among the sailors; but <ref target="a015" corresp="n015">it would not turn to

<p>It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas: let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of <ref target="a016" corresp="n016">Van Diemen's Land</ref><note xml:id="n016" target="a016"> Van Diemen's Land was the Dutch name used for what is now the Australian island of Tasmania. Source: https://www.britannica.com/place/Van-Diemens-Land</note>. By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labor and ill food, the rest were in a very weak condition. On the fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock, <ref target="a017" corresp="n017">within half a cable's length of the ship</ref> <note xml:id="n017" target="a017"> A cable's length was a nautical measurement that is roughly 608 feet, so the rock was spied within approximately 304 feet off the ship Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship, and the rock. We rowed by my computation  about <pb n="004"/> <ref target="a018" corresp="n018">three leagues</ref> <note xml:id="n018" target="a018"> A league is a unit of measurement equal to approximately 2.4 - 4.6 miles. Thus three leagues is 7.2 - 13.8 miles Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labor while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and couldfeel no bottom: but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The <ref target="a019" corresp="n019">declivity</ref> <note xml:id="n019" target="a019"> Declivity is a descending incline Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was so small, that I walked near a mile  before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock 
 in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so  weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely 
tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and 
soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, above nine hours; for when I awakened, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir for, as I happened to he on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in 
<pb n="005"/> the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing 
 gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a 
 quiver at his back. In the meantime, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full 
sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, <hi rend="italics">Hekinah degul</hi>: the others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew  not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness: at length, struggling to get loose, I  had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me, and at the same time, with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings 
<pb n="006"/> that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, <hi rend="italics">tolgo phonac</hi>; when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,  which pricked me like so many needles; and besides they shot another flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain, and then striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley larger  than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but, by good luck, I had on me <ref target="a020" corresp="n020">a buff jerkin</ref> <note xml:id="n020" target="a020"> A vest or jacket that was yellowish-beige due to the material it was made from. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, which they could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more 
 arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a <pb n="007"/> stage erected, about a foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times <hi rend="italics">langro dehul san</hi>: (these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me). Whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and 
cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle 
age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him, whereof one was a <ref target="a021" corresp="n021">page</ref> <note xml:id="n021" target="a021"> A page is a servant, often young Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> that held up his <ref target="a022" corresp="n022">train</ref> <note xml:id="n022" target="a022"> A train is the bottom of a robe, dress, or coat. If a train is long enough it will drag on the ground and thus a royal's train would be carried by servants Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on each side to support him. He acted every part of an orator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity, and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun, as calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not <ref target="a023" corresp="n023">forbear</ref><note xml:id="n023" target="a023"> Forbear means "to bear, endure, or submit to" Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger frequently on my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. The Hurgo (for so they call a great lord, as I afterwards <pb n="008"/>  learned) understood me very well. He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been provided, and sent thither by the King's orders, upon the first 
    intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh ofseveral animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a <ref target="a024" corresp="n024">lark</ref> <note xml:id="n024" target="a024"> A lark is a type of small brown bird, often known as a songbird Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>bigness of <ref target="a025" corresp="n025">musket bullets</ref> <note xml:id="n025" target="a025"> The diameter of a musket ball was half an inch on average. Source: https://classroom.synonym.com/identify-revolutionary-war-musket-balls-7633630.html</note>. They supplied me as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me, and being a most ingenious people, they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest<ref target="a026" corresp="n026">hogsheads</ref> <note xml:id="n026" target="a026"> A hogshead is a cask or barrel Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top; I drank it off at a <ref target="a027" corresp="n027">draught</ref> <note xml:id="n027" target="a027"> Draught is the "drawing of liquid into the mouth or down the throat; an act of drinking, a drink; the quantity of drink swallowed at one 'pull'" Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same manner, and made signs for more, but they had none to give me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first, 
<hi rend="italics">hekinah degul</hi>. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first <pb n="009"/>warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, <hi rend="italics">borach mivola</hi>, and when they saw the vessels in the air,there was a universal shout of <hi rend="italics">hekinah degul</hi>. I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of honor I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive behavior, soon drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so<ref target="a028" corresp="n028">prodigious</ref> <note xml:id="n028" target="a028"> Prodigious is an adjective meaning amazing, or extraordinary Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> a creature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg,advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his <ref target="a029" corresp="n029">retinue</ref> <note xml:id="n029" target="a029"> The king's retinue is a group of his attendants or closest servants Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. And producing his credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger,but with a kind of determinate resolution; often pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half  a mile distant, whither it was agreed by <pb n="010"/> his Majesty in council that Imust be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made  a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook  his head by way of <ref target="a030" corresp="n030">disapprobation</ref> <note xml:id="n030" target="a030"> Disapprobation is "the act of disapproving" Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and held his hand in a posture to  show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting  to break my bonds, but again, when I felt the <ref target="a031" corresp="n031">smart</ref> <note xml:id="n031" target="a031"> A smart is the feeling of sharp pain inflicted by some outside source Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of their arrows  upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they  might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the Hurgo and his train withdrew with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words,<hi rend="italics">peplom selan</hi>, and I felt great numbers of the people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with <ref target="a032" corresp="n032">making water</ref> <note xml:id="n032" target="a032"> To "make water" is to urinate Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; which I very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people, who conjecturing  by my motions what I was going to do, immediately opened to the right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent which fell with such noise and violence from me. But before this, they had <pb n="011"/> 
<ref target="a033" corresp="n033">daubed</ref> <note xml:id="n033" target="a033"> To daub means to cover or put on. In this context they are daubing on the ointment Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the smell, which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows. These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their <ref target="a034" corresp="n034">victuals</ref> <note xml:id="n034" target="a034"> Victuals is food, thus they're providing Gulliver with food and drink Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and  it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's order, had  mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine.

 <p>It seems that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing, the Emperor had early notice of it by an  express; and determined in council that I should be tied in the manner I have related (which was done in the night while I slept), that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city. </p>
            <lb/>
                    <lb/>
 <p>This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am  confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like occasion; however, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as 
generous. For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with their spears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly have awakened with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused 
my rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they could expect no mercy.

 <p>These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to great perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the Emperor, <pb n="012"/> who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great weights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which it seems set out in four hours after my landing. It was brought parallel to me as I lay. But the principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords of the bigness of <ref target="a035" corresp="n035">packthread</ref> <note xml:id="n035" target="a035"> Packthread is small twine or thread used to sew or close up bags Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> were fastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had <ref target="a036" corresp="n036">girt</ref> <note xml:id="n036" target="a036"> Girt is the past tense of gird meaning to bind or to secure something Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> round my neck, my hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles, and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast. All this I was told, for while the whole operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by the force of that <ref target="a037" corresp="n037">soporiferous</ref> <note xml:id="n037" target="a037"> Soporiferous means: to cause someone to fall asleep. Thus the medicine will cause him to sleep or pass out Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> medicine infused into my liquor. Fifteen  hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and a half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I said, was half a mile distant.

 <p>About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while to adjust something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer in the Guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze violently: whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew the cause of my awaking so suddenly. We made a long march the remaining part of that day, and rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise we continued our march, and arrived  within two hundred yards of the city gates about noon. The Emperor, and all his court, came out to meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his Majesty to endanger his person by mounting on my body.

                    <lb/>
 <p>At the place where the carriage stopped, there stood an ancient temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, which having been polluted some years before by <ref target="a038" corresp="n038">an unnatural murder</ref> <note xml:id="n038" target="a038"> This seems to be an allusion to the beheading of King Charles I that occurred at the Banqueting-House at White-Hall.

In this edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was <pb n="014"/> about four feet high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep. On each side of the gate was a small window not above six inches from the ground: into that on the left side, the King's smiths <ref target="a039" corresp="n039">conveyed fourscore and eleven chains</ref> <note xml:id="n039" target="a039"> Fourscore is four times twenty or eighty. So thus there were 91 chains. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, like those that hang to a lady's watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six and thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there was a turret at least five feet high. Here the Emperor ascended with many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; and in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten thousand, at several times, who mounted upon my body by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of death. When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life. But the noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semi-circle; but, being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in the temple.

                <p>I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last unburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame. The best <ref target="a041" corresp="n041">expedient</ref> <note xml:id="n041" target="a041"> An expedient is something done so one can quickly achieve something Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> I could think of, was to creep into my house, which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I <pb n="016"/> went as far as the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that uneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full extent of my chain, and due care was taken every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheelbarrows, by two servants appointed for that purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance, that perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness to the world; which I am told some of my <ref target="a042" corresp="n042">maligners</ref> <note xml:id="n042" target="a042"> Maligners refers to the people who have "maligned" him or attacked him publically.

                <p>When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having occasion for fresh air. The Emperor was already descended from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, he reared up on his hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his Majesty had time to dismount. When he <ref target="a043" corresp="n043">alighted</ref> <note xml:id="n043" target="a043"> Alighted is to come down or get down from something like a bus or a horse Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, he surveyed me round with great admiration, but kept without the length of my chain. He ordered <pb n="017"/> his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicle upon wheels till I could reach them. I took these vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls, and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The Empress, and young Princes of the blood, of both sexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that happened to the Emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip and <ref target="a044" corresp="n044">arched nose,</ref> <note xml:id="n044" target="a044"> The arched nose is most like a reference to William III who also had that defining feature.

For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it <ref target="a049" corresp="n049">between the Asiatic and the European</ref> <note xml:id="n049" target="a49"> This is a nod to George I who had Turkish servants and thus was often depicted in Turkish dress.

He held his sword drawn in his hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was almost three inches long, the hilt and <ref target="c049" corresp="n999">scabbard</ref><note xml:id="n999" target ="c049">A sheath for a sword.

The ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad, so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread on the ground, embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither of us could understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I conjectured by their habits) who were commanded to address themselves to me, and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least smattering of, which were <ref target="a050" corresp="n050"> High </ref><note xml:id="n050" target="a050"> Language from the highlands in Southern Germany, now the German Language.

After about two hours the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they dare, and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands, which some of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach; I took <pb n="019"/> them all in my right hand, put five of them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket, and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court. </p> <lb/>
     <lb/>             
 <p>Towards night I with some difficulty got into my house, where I lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time the Emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn together made up the breadth and length, and these were four double, which however kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth stone. By the same computation they provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to hardships as I. </p> <lb/>
     <lb/>
 <p>As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage and household affairs must have ensued, if his <pb n="020"/> Imperial Majesty had not provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me should return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house without license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got considerable fees. </p> <lb/>
 <lb/>
                <p>In the meantime, the Emperor held frequent councils to debate what course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a particular friend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to be as much in the secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose, that my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me, or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon dispatch me: but again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the whole kingdom. In the midst of these consultations, several officers of the army went to the door of the great council chamber; and two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six criminals above mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in the breast of his Majesty and the whole board in my behalf, that an Imperial Commission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six <ref target="a053" corresp="n053"> Beeves </ref><note xml:id="n053" target="a053"> Oxen or cattle. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine, and <pb n="021"/> other liquors for the due payment of which his Majesty gave assignments upon his treasury. For this prince lives chiefly upon his own <ref target="a054" corresp="n054"> demesnes </ref><note xml:id="n054" target="a054"> Land held by the state. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own expense. An establishment was-also made of six hundred persons to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door. It was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes after the fashion of the country: that six of his Majesty's greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language: and, lastly, that the Emperor's horses, and those of the nobility, and troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to me. All these orders were duly put in execution, and in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language; during which time the Emperor frequently honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and the first words I learned were to express my desire that he would please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees. His answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that first I must <hi rend="italics">lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo</hi>; that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with all kindness; and he advised me to <pb n="022"/> acquire, by my patience and discreet behavior, the good opinion of himself and his subjects. He desired I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the bulk of so prodigious a person. I said, his Majesty should be satisfied, for I was ready to strip myself, and turn out my pockets before him. This I delivered part in words, and part in signs. He replied, that by the laws of the kingdom I must be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands: that whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them. I took up the two officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me, except my two <ref target="a055" corresp="n055"> fobs </ref><note xml:id="n055" target="a055"> A small pocket, usually for watches, money, or small valuables. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and another secret pocket I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper about them, made an exact inventory of everything they saw; and when they were through, desired I would set them down, that they might deliver it to the Emperor. This inventory I afterwards translated that into English, and is word for word as follows. <pb n="023"/> </p> <lb/>

Placed at the top of many legal documents of the time, from wills to inventories. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, In the right coat pocket of the Great Man Mountain (for so I interpret the words <hi rend="italics">quinbus flestrin</hi>) after the strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to be a foot cloth for your Majesty's chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we the searchers were not able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set us both sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the palisades before your Majesty's court; wherewith we conjecture the Man-Mountain combs his head, for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket on the right side of his middle cover (so I translate the word <hi rend="italics">ranfu-lo</hi>, by which they meant my breeches) we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber, larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of. In the left pocket, <pb n="024"/> another engine of the same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other, there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and to cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was fastened to that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal: for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance. He put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise like that of a <pb n="025"/> water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us (if we understood him right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did anything without consulting it: he called it his oracle, and said it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a purse, and serve him for the same use: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value.

                <p>Having thus, in obedience to your Majesty's commands, diligently searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal; from which, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your Majesty's subjects. In one of these cells were several globes or balls of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.

                <p>When this inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me, although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars. He first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In the meantime he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge: but I did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was in most parts exceeding bright. I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His Majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six foot from the end of my chain. The next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he meant my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with powder, which by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to provide) I first cautioned the Emperor not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even <pb n="027"/> the Emperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from the fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air. I likewise delivered up my watch, which the Emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his learned men about him, which were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly understand them. I then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and journal-book. My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in carriages to his Majesty's stores; but the rest of my goods were returned me.

                    <p>My gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the Emperor and his court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I took all possible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand. And last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide and seek in my hair. I had now made good progress in understanding and speaking their language. The Emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with several of the country shows, wherein they exceeded all nations I have known, both for dexterity and magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the <ref target="a058" corresp="n058"> Rope-dancers </ref><note xml:id="n058" target="a058"> A tightrope-esque performance using a slackline suspended above the ground, usually involving acrobatics.

                    <lb/>
                    <p>This diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates for great employments and high favors at court. They are trained in this art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal education. When a great office is vacant either by death or disgrace (which often happens) five or six of those candidates petition the Emperor to entertain his Majesty and the court with a dance on the rope, and whoever jumps the highest without falling, succeeds in the office. Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their skill, and to convince the Emperor that they have not lost their faculty. <ref target="a059" corresp="n059"> Flimnap </ref><note xml:id="n059" target="a059"> Flimnap was believed to be an allegory of Sir Robert Walpole, especially with his perceived ability to twist and turn to fit the political clime.

                    <lb/>
                    <p>These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great numbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three candidates break a limb. But the danger is much greater when the <pb n="030"/> ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity; for by contending to excell themselves and their fellows, they strain so far, that there is hardly one of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three. I was assured that a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would have infallibly broken his neck, if one of the King's cushions, that accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall. </p> <lb/>
                    <lb/>
<p>There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the Emperor and Empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions. The Emperor lays on the table <ref target="a062" corresp="n062"> three fine silken threads </ref><note xml:id="n062" target="a062"> The silken threads are the same colors as the Order of the Garter, Order of Bath, and Order of the Thistle. These were military and civilian order conferred based on merit. Swift was satirizing the focus on what he saw as arbitrary distinctions and awards.

Swift was upset and wrote a note decrying this change in subsequent editions. (will this be a sidebar?)</note> of six inches long. One is blue, the other red, and the third green. These threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the Emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor. The ceremony is performed in his Majesty's great chamber of state, where the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the old or the new world. The Emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the candidates, advancing one by one, sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it backwards and forwards several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the Emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other; sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and creeping, is <pb n="031"/> rewarded with the blue-colored silk; the red is given to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this court who are not adorned with one of these girdles. </p> <lb/>
<lb/>                       
                    <p>The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand as I held it on the ground, and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, upon a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a  prodigious leap. I had the good fortune to divert the Emperor one day after a very extraordinary manner. I desired he would order several sticks two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his Majesty commanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I took nine of these sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks rising about five inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side. When I had finished my work, I desired the Emperor to let a troop of his best horse, twentyfour in number, come and exercise upon this plain. His Majesty <pb n="032"/> approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one in my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they got into order, they divided into two parties, performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in Short <ref target="a063" corresp="n063"> discovered </ref><note xml:id="n063" target="a063"> Revealed. Souce: Oxford English Dictionary</note> the best military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling over the stage; and the Emperor was so much delighted, that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command; and, with great difficulty, persuaded even the Empress herself to let me hold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was able to take a full view of the whole performance. It was my good fortune that no ill accident happened in these entertainments, only once a fiery horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his hoof struck a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt, and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could: however I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises. </p> <lb/>
                        <lb/>                 
                        <p>About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was entertaining the court with these kind of feats, there arrived an express to inform his <pb n="033"/> Majesty that some of his subjects riding near the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as wide as his Majesty's bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that it was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on the grass without motion, and some of them had walked round it several tunes: that by mounting upon each other's shoulders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even, and stamping upon it they found it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something belonging to the Man-Mountain, and if his Majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only five horses. I presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence. It seems upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such confusion, that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident which I never observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated his Imperial Majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were <pb n="034"/> tied by a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an English mile: but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
                    <p>Two days after this adventure, the Emperor having ordered that part of his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in a readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner. He desired I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I conveniently could. He then commanded his General (who was an old experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in close order, and march them under me, the foot by twentyfour <ref target="a064" corresp="n064"> in a breast </ref><note xml:id="n064" target="a064"> Abreast. Souce: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colors flying, and pikes advanced. This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand horse. His Majesty gave orders, upon pain of death, that every soldier in his march should observe the strictest decency with regard to my person; which, however, could not prevent some of the younger officers from turning up their eyes as they passed under me. And, to confess the truth, my breeches were at that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded some opportunities for laughter and admiration. </p> <lb/>
        <lb/>
                    <p>I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his Majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then in a full council; where it was opposed by none, except <ref target="a065" corresp="n065"> Skyresh Bolgolam </ref><note xml:id="n065" target="a065"> Believed to be a reference to the Second Earl of Nottingham.

But it was carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the Emperor. That minister was Galbet, or Admiral of the Realm, very much in his master's confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself. These articles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person, attended by two under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction. After they were read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them; first in the manner of my own country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws; which was to hold my right foot in my left hand, to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the tip of my right ear. But because the reader may perhaps be curious to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to that people, as well as to know the articles upon which I recovered my liberty, I have made a translation of the whole instrument word for word, as near as I was able, which I here offer to the public. </p> <lb/>

            <p>First, The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without our license under our great seal. </p> <lb/>

            <lb/>
            <p>4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses, or carriages, nor take any of our said subjects into his hands, without their own consent. </p> <lb/>
            <lb/>
            <p>5th, If an express requires extraordinary dispatch, the Man-Mountain shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a six days journey once in every moon, and return the said messenger back (if so required) safe to our Imperial Presence. </p> <lb/>
            <lb/>
            <p>6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the Island of Blefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now preparing to invade us. </p> <lb/>
            <lb/>
            <p>7th, That the said Man-Mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be aiding and assisting to our workmen, <pb n="037"/> in helping to raise certain great stones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other of our royal buildings. </p> <lb/>
            <lb/>

            <lb/>
                    <p> Lastly, That upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles, the said Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 of our subjects, with free access to our Royal Person, and other marks of our favor.

            <lb/>
            <p>I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and content, although some of them were not so honorable as I could have wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam the High Admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at full liberty; the Emperor himself in person did me the honor to be by at the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgments by <ref target="c0002" corresp="n0002">prostrating</ref><note xml:id="n0002" target="c0002">The act of prostration is similar to kneeling or bowing, and is meant to show submission to a higher power.

            <lb/>
            <p>The reader may please to observe, that in the last article for the recovery of my liberty the Emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of meat and <pb n="038"/> drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 Lilliputians.

                    <lb/>
<p>The first request I made after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis, which the Emperor easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice by proclamation of my design to visit the town. The wall which encompassed it is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked <pb n="039"/> with strong towers at ten feet distance. I stepped over the great Gate, and passed very gently, and <ref target="c0005" corresp="n0005">sideling</ref><note xml:id="n0005" target="c0005">Moving Sideways. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> through the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat. I walked with the utmost <ref target="c0006" corresp="n0006">circumspection</ref><note xml:id="n0006" target="c0006">Caution. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, to avoid treading on any stragglers, that might remain in the streets, although the orders were very strict, that all people should keep in their houses at their own peril. The <ref target="c0007" corresp="n0007">garret windows</ref><note xml:id="n0007" target="c0007">Garret windows are windows in the roofs of buildings. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> and tops of houses were so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not seen a more populous place. The city is an exact square, each side of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great streets, which run cross and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide. The lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only viewed them as I passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of holding five hundred thousand souls. The houses are from three to five stories. The shops and markets well provided. </p> <lb/>
                    <lb/>
<p>The Emperor's palace is in the centre of the city, where the two great streets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet distant from the buildings. I had his Majesty's permission to step over this wall; and the space being so wide between that and the palace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, <pb n="040"/> were but eighteen inches high and seven inches wide. Now the buildings of the outer court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the same time the Emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city. Of these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The people having received notice a second time, I went again through the city to the palace, with my two stools in my hands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the other in my hand: this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide. I then stepped over the buildings very conveniently from one stool to the other, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick.

There I saw the Empress and the young Princes, in their several lodgings, with their chief attendants about them. Her Imperial Majesty was pleased to smile <pb n="041"/> very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand to kiss. </p> <lb/>

<p>But I shall not anticipate the reader with farther descriptions of 
this kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now 
almost ready for the press, containing a general description of this 
empire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes, 
with a particular account of their wars and politics, laws, 
learning, and religion: their plants and animals, their peculiar 
manners and customs, with other matters very curious and useful; my 
chief design at present being only to relate such events and 
transactions as happened to the public, or to myself, during a 
residence of about nine months in that empire. </p> <lb/>

<p>One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty, Reldresal, principal Secretary (as they style him) of Private Affairs, came to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour's audience; which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal merits, as well as the many good offices he had done me during my solicitations at court. I offered to lie down, that he might the more conveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty; said he might pretend to some merit in it: but, however, added, that if it had not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. <pb n="042"/> For, said he, as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labor under two mighty evils; a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion by a most potent enemy from abroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that for above seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire, under the names of<ref target="a078b" corresp="n078b"> Tramecksan and Slamecksan</ref><note xml:id="n078b" target="a078b"> "In the names themselves, Swift may, by reversing foreign words, be indicating to the reader the original difference between the two parties, a difference not in heels but in noses.

"Nas" is of course still a French variant for "nez"-or may be the root of "nasus"-while "keemart" is a fairly accurate phonetic spelling of "camard".

It is alleged indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient constitution: but however this be, his Majesty has determined to make use of only low heels in the administration of the government, and all offices in the gift of the Crown, as you cannot but observe; and particularly, that his Majesty's Imperial heels are lower at least by a drurr than any of his court; (drurr is a measure about the fourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between these two parties run so high, that they will neither eat nor drink, nor talk with each other. We compute the Tramecksan, or High-Heels, to exceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend his Imperial Highness, the Heir to the Crown, to have some tendency towards the High-Heels; at least we can plainly discover one of his heels higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait. Now, in the midst of these <ref target="c0009" corresp="n0009">intestine</ref><note xml:id="n0009" target="c0009">Internal or domestic. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the Island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire <pb n="043"/> of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his Majesty. For as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals of your bulk would, in a short time, destroy all the fruits and cattle of his Majesty's dominions.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase</note> past. It began upon the following occasion. It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the larger end: but his present Majesty's grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the Emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their eggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell us there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions were constantly <ref target="c0012" corresp="n0012">fomented</ref><note xml:id="n0012" target="c0012">Roused or instigated. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is computed, that eleven thousand persons have, at <pb n="044"/> several times, suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many hundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy: but the books of the <ref target="c0013" corresp="n0013">Big-Endians</ref><note xml:id="n0013" target="c0013">Jianna gave us slides regarding the computer context of this.</note> have been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding employments. During the course of these troubles, the Emperors of Blefuscu did frequently <ref target="c0014" corresp="n0014">exposulate</ref><note xml:id="n0014" target="c0014">Express disapproval.

This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text: for the words are these; That all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient end: and which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion, to be left to every man's conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to determine. Now the Big-Endian exiles have found so much credit in the Emperor of Blefuscu's court, and so much private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for six and thirty moons with various success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon us; and his Imperial Majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and strength, has <pb n="045"/> commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you. </p> <lb/>

    <lb/>
<p>The Empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the north-northeast side of Lilliput, from whence it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred yards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended invasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of being discovered by some of the enemy's ships, who had received no intelligence of me, all intercourse between the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo laid by our Emperor upon all vessels whatsoever. I communicated to his Majesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy's whole fleet: which, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbor ready to <pb n="046"/> sail with the first fair wind. I consulted the most experienced seamen, upon the depth of the channel, which they had often <ref target="c0017" corresp="n0017">plumbed</ref><note xml:id="n0017" target="n0017">Measured the depths of. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, who told me, that in the middle at high-water it was seventy glumgluffs deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs at most. I walked towards the northeast coast over against Blefuscu; and lying down behind a <ref target="c0018" corresp="n0018">hillock</ref><note xml:id="n0018" target="c0018">A little hill. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, took out my small pocket perspective glass, and viewed the enemy's fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty <ref target="c0019" corresp="n0019">men of war</ref><note xml:id="n0019" target="c0019">A man-of-war is a warship. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and a great number of transports; I then came back to my house, and gave order (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a knitting needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, binding the extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the northeast coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my leather jerkin, about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty yards till I felt ground; I arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so frighted when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand souls. I then took my tackling, and fastening a hook to a hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand <pb n="047"/> 
arrows, many of which stuck in my hands and face; and besides the excessive smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was for my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept among other little necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before, had escaped the Emperor's searchers. These I took out and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed went on boldly with my work in spite of the enemy's arrows, many of which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I now fastened all the hooks, and taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving above two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy's men-of-war after me. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended, were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a <pb n="048"/> scream of grief and despair, that it is almost impossible to describe or conceive. When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>The Emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the issue of this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a large half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water. When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet in more pain, because I was under water to my neck. The Emperor concluded me to be drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching in a hostile manner: but he was soon eased of his fears, for the channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a loud voice, Long live the most <ref target="c0020" corresp="n0020">puissant</ref><note xml:id="n0020" target="c0020">The french word for powerful. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>Emperor of Lilliput! This great prince received me at my landing with all possible <ref target="c0021" corresp="n0021">ecomiums</ref><note xml:id="n0021" target="c0021">A formal,written praise. Source: Oxford English Dictioanry</note>, and created me a Nardac upon the spot, which is the highest title of honor among them. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>His Majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all the rest of his enemy's ships into his ports. And so unmeasurable is the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of <pb n="049"/> nothing less than reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it by a Viceroy; of destroying the Big-Endian exiles, and compelling that people to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain the sole monarch of the whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from this design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as justice; and I plainly protested, that I would never be an instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery. And when the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and politics of his Imperial Majesty, that he could never forgive it; he mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told that some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some expressions, which by a <ref target="c0022" corresp="n0022">side-wind</ref><note xml:id="n0022" target="c0022">An indirect means or influence. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> reflected on me. And from this time began an intrigue between his Majesty and a <ref target="c0023" corresp="n0023">junto</ref><note xml:id="n0023" target="c0023">A faction, generally in politics. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of ministers maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months, and had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of so little weight are the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a refusal to gratify their passions. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy from Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace; which was soon concluded upon conditions very advantageous to our Emperor, wherewith I shall not trouble the reader. There were six <pb n="050"/> ambassadors, with a train of about five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business. When their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices by the credit I now had, or at least appeared to have at court, their Excellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend, made me a visit in form. They began with many compliments upon my valor and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the Emperor their master's name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength, of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them, but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>When I had for some time entertained their Excellencies, to their infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honor to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their master, the renown of whose had so justly filled the whole world with admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned to my own country: accordingly, the next time I had the honor to see our Emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could plainly perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I had a whisper from a certain person, that Flimnap and Bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of disaffection, from which I am sure my heart was wholly free. And this was the first time I began <pb n="051"/> to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and ministers. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongues, with an avowed contempt for that of their neighbor; yet our Emperor, standing upon the advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to deliver their credentials, and make their speech in the Lilliputian tongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of exiles, which is mutual among them, and from the custom in each empire to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men and manners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation both tongues; as I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, which in the midst of great misfortunes, through the malice of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in its proper place. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked upon account of their being too servile, neither could anything but an extreme necessity have forced me to submit. But <pb n="052"/> being now a Nardac, of the highest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and the Emperor (to do him justice) never once mentioned them to me. However, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his Majesty, at least, as I then thought, a most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by which being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror. I heard the word burglum repeated incessantly: several of the Emperor's court, making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to the Palace, where her Imperial Majesty's apartment was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honor, who fell asleep while she was reading a romance. I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the Palace without trampling on any of the people. I found they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance. These buckets were about the size of a large thimble, and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they could; but the flame was so violent that they did little good. I might easily have stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would have infallibly been burned down to the ground, if, by a presence of mind, unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought <pb n="053"/> of an expedient. I had the evening before drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine, called glimigrim (the Blefuscudians call it flunec, but ours is esteemed the better sort), which is very <ref target="c0024" corresp="n0024">diuretic</ref><note xml:id="n0024" target="c0024">A substance that causes the increased production of urine. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. By the luckiest chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it. The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by laboring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate my urine; which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>It was now daylight, and I returned to my house without waiting to congratulate with the Emperor: because, although I had done a very eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his Majesty might resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace. But I was a little comforted by a message from his Majesty, that he would give orders to the Grand Justiciary for passing my pardon in form; which, however, I could not obtain. And I was privately assured, that the Empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done, removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in the presence of her chief confidants could not forbear vowing revenge. <pb n="054"/> </p>

<p>Although I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular treatise, yet in the meantime I am content to gratify the curious reader with some general ideas. As the common size of the natives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an inch and a half, more or less: their geese about the bigness of a sparrow,and so the several gradations downwards till you come to the smallest, which, to my sight, were almost invisible; but nature had adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with great exactness, but at no great distance. And to show the sharpness of their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased with observing a cook <ref target="a081" corresp="n081">pulling a lark</ref><note xml:id="n081" target="a081">Plucking the lark’s feather. Source: Source still needed (the book)</note>, which was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk. Their tallest trees are about seven feet high; I mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my fist clenched. The other vegetables are in the <pb n="055"/> same proportion; but this I leave to the reader's imagination. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>I shall say but little at present of their learning, which for many ages had flourished in all its branches among them; but their manner of writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right, like the Europeans; nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians; nor from up to down, like the Chinese; nor from down to up, like the <ref target="a082" corresp="n082">Cascagians</ref><note xml:id="n082" target="a082">EXPLAIN</note>; but aslant from one corner of the paper to the other, like ladies in England. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>They bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because they hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise again, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet. The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I should be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only to be wished that they were as well executed. The first I shall mention relates to informers. All crimes against the state are punished here with the utmost severity; but if the person accused makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an <ref target="a083" corresp="n083">ignominious</ref><note xml:id="n083" target="a083">Involving shame or disgrace. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> death; and out of his goods or lands, the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he underwent, for the hardship of <pb n="056"/> his imprisonment, and for all the <ref target="a084" corresp="n084">charges he had been at</ref><note xml:id="n084" target="a084">Expenses incurred Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>in making his defense. Or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely supplied by the Crown. The Emperor does also confer on him some public mark of his favor, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole city. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man's goods from thieves, but honesty has no fence against superior cunning; and since it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always undone, and the <ref target="a085" corresp="n085">knave</ref><note xml:id="n085" target="a085">A dishonest unprincipled man; a cunning unscrupulous rogue; a villain. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> gets the advantage. I remember when I was once interceding with the King for a criminal who had wronged his master of a great sum of money, which he had received by order, and ran away with; and happening to tell his Majesty, by way of <ref target="a086" corresp="n086">extenuation</ref><note xml:id="n086" target="a086">The action of representing something as slight; underrating. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, that it was only a breach of trust; the Emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer, as a defense, the greatest aggravation of the crime: and truly I had little to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different nations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in <pb n="057"/> practice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can there bring sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to his quality and condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of Snilpall, or Legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to his posterity. And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced only by penalties without any mention of reward. It is upon this account that the image of justice, in their courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show she is more disposed to reward than to punish. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good morals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to mankind, they believe-that the common size of human understandings is fitted to some station or other, and that Providence never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery, to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man's power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good intention, <pb n="058"/> would qualify any man for the service of his country, except where a course of study is required. But they thought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and at least, that the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous disposition, would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the <ref target="a087" corresp="n087">practices</ref><note xml:id="n087" target="a087">Schemes, intrigues, maneuvers. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and had great abilities to manage, and multiply, and defend his corruptions. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority under which he acts.   </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man. For as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favor and distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of the Emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the gradual increase of party and faction. <pb n="059"/> </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p> Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been in some other countries; for they reason thus, that whoever makes ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a man is not fit to live. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ extremely from ours. For since the conjunction of male and female is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are joined together like other animals, by the motives of <ref target="a088" corresp="n088">concupiscence</ref><note xml:id="n088" target="a088">Eager or vehement desire; the coveting of carnal things. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; and that their tenderness towards their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason they will never allow, that a child is under any obligation to his father for begetting him, or his mother for bringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a benefit itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts in their love-encounters were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own children: and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents, except cottagers and laborers, are obliged to send their infants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the age of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments of docility. These schools are of several <pb n="060"/> kinds, suited to different qualities, and to both sexes. They have certain professors well skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of their parents, and their own capacities as well as inclinations. I shall say something of the male nurseries, and then of the female. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The clothes and food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred up in the principles of honor, justice, courage, modesty, <ref target="a089" corresp="n089">clemency</ref><note xml:id="n089" target="a089">Mildness or gentleness of temper, as shown in the exercise of authority or power; mercy, leniency. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours for diversions, consisting of bodily exercises. They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so great; and the women attendants, who are aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial offices. They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go together in small or greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which our children are subject. Their parents are suffered to see them only twice a year; the visit is to last but an hour. They are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on those occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any <pb n="061"/> fondling expressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the Emperor's officers. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old, whereas those of persons of quality continue in their exercises till fifteen, which answers to one and twenty with us: but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come to dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practiced by chambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a year and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country. Thus the young ladies there are as much ashamed of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their education, made by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of <pb n="062"/> learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is, that among people of quality a wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be young. When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the young lady and her companions. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at nine years old, the rest are to thirteen. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in their expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more unjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring children into the world and leave the burden of supporting them on the public. As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with good husbandry, and the most exact justice. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>The cottagers and laborers keep their children at home, their business being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education is of <pb n="063"/> little consequence to the public; but the old and diseased among them are supported by hospitals: for begging is a trade unknown in this kingdom. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>And here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a residence of nine months and thirteen days. Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred seamstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The seamstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while the third measured the length of the cord with a rule an inch long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon <pb n="064"/> this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a <ref target="a090" corresp="n090">plumb-line</ref><note xml:id="n090" target="a090">A line or cord with a weight at one end, for determining the vertical. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat; but my waist and arms I measured myself. When my clothes finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold them) they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a color. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/> 
    <p>I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared me two dishes apiece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed them on the table; a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine, and other liquors, slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we draw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bits of it; but this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it bones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I must confess they far exceed ours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>One day his Imperial Majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired that himself and his Royal <pb n="065"/> Consort, with the young Princes of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness (as he was pleased to call it) of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I placed them upon chairs of state on my table, just over against me, with their guards about them. Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer, attended there likewise with his <ref target="a092" corresp="n092">white staff</ref><note xml:id="n092" target="a092">Symbol of the office of Lord High Treasurer. Source: (need a source)</note>; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honor to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration. I have some private reasons to believe, that this visit from his Majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master. That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his nature. He represented to the Emperor the low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to take up money at great discount; that <ref target="a093" corresp="n093">exchequer</ref><note xml:id="n093" target="a093">A royal or national treasury. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>bills would not circulate under nine per cent below par; that in short I had cost his Majesty above a million and a half of sprugs (their greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a <ref target="a094" corresp="n094">spangle</ref><note xml:id="n094" target="a094">A small round thin piece of glittering metal (usually brass) with a hole in the centre to pass a thread through, used for the decoration of textile fabrics and other materials of various sorts. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>) and upon the whole, that it would be advisable in the Emperor to take the first fair occasion of dismissing me. 
</p> <lb/> 
        <lb/> 
        <p>I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account. The Treasurer took a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed him that her Grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court-scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to <pb n="066"/> 
my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, farther than that her Grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and friendship. I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the court. And I still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door without knowing what persons were in it. On those occasions, when a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the door; and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two horses very carefully in my hands (for if there were six horses, the postillion always unharnessed four) and place them on a table, where I had fixed a moveable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent accidents. And I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my table full of company, while I sat in my chair leaning my face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen would gently drive the others round my table. I have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these conversations. But I defy the Treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make their best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me <hi rend="italics">incognito</hi>, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express command of his Imperial Majesty, as I have before related. I should not have dwelt so long upon this <pb n="067"/> particular, if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the honor to be a Nardac, which the Treasurer himself is not; for all the world knows he is only a Glumglum, a title inferior by one degree, as that of a Marquis is to a Duke in England, although I allow he preceded me in right of his post. These false informations, which I afterwards came to the knowledge of, by an accident not proper to mention, made Flimnap the Treasurer show his lady for some time an ill countenance, and me a worse; and although he were at last undeceived and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my interest decline very fast with the Emperor himself, who was indeed too much governed by that favorite.

<lb/>    
  
<p>Before I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two months forming against me. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts, for which I was unqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers; but never expected to have found such <pb n="068"/> terrible effects of them in so remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in Europe. </p> <lb/>
    <lb/>
    <p>When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the Emperor of Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his Imperial Majesty) came to my house very privately at night in a close chair, and without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his Lordship in it, into my coat-pocket: and giving orders to a trusty servant to say I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it. After the common salutations were over, observing his Lordship's countenance full of concern, and enquiring into the reason, he desired I would hear him with patience in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life. His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>You are to know, said he, that several Committees of Council have been lately called in the most private manner on your account; and it is but two days since his Majesty came to a full resolution. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam (Galbet, or High Admiral) has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival. His original reasons I know not, but his hatred is much increased since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as Admiral is obscured. This Lord, in conjunction <pb n="069"/> with Flimnap the High Treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his lady,<ref target="a078a" corresp="n078a"> Limtoc the General</ref><note xml:id="n078a" target="a078a"> "Swift may be using the phrase milles cottes - thousand coats - then neatly removing the phonetically valueless [les] and [tes], reversing the two words and obtaining Limtoc." -H.

    <lb/> 
    <p>This preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt; when he entreated me to be silent, and thus proceeded. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>Out of gratitude for the favors you have done me, I procured information of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles, wherein I venture my head for your service. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p><hi rend="italics">Articles of Impeachment against</hi> Quinbus Flestrin<lb/> (<hi rend="italics">the </hi>Man-Mountain) </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>ARTICLE I<lb/> Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his Imperial Majesty Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that whoever shall make water within the precincts of the royal palace, should be liable to the pains and penalties of high treason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under color of extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his Majesty's most dear Imperial Consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by discharge of his urine, put out the said fire kindled in the said apartment, lying and being within the precincts of the said royal palace, against the statute in that case provided, etc., against the duty, etc. <pb n="070"/> </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>ARTICLE II.<lb/> That the said Quinbus Flestrin having brought the imperial fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his Imperial Majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a Viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death not only all the Big-Endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire, who would not immediately forsake the Big-Endian heresy: He, the said Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most Auspicious, Serene, Imperial Majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service upon pretense of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent people. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>ARTICLE III.<lb/> That, whereas certain ambassadors from the court of Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his Majesty's court: He, the said Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a Prince who was lately an open enemy to his Imperial Majesty, and in open war against his said Majesty. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>ARTICLE IV.<lb/> That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire of Blefuscu, for <pb n="071"/> which he had received only verbal license from his Imperial Majesty; and under color of the said license, doth falsely and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and hereby to aid, comfort, and abet the Emperor of Blefuscu, so late an enemy, and in open war with his Imperial Majesty aforesaid.<lb/> </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>There are some other articles, but these are the most important, of which I have read you an abstract. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed that his Majesty gave many marks of his great lenity, often urging the services you had done him, and endeavoring to extenuate your crimes. The Treasurer and Admiral insisted that you should be put to the most painful and ignominious death, by setting fire on your house at night, and the General was to attend with twenty thousand men armed with poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands. Some of your servants were to have private orders to strew a<ref target="a067" corresp="n067"> poisonous juice on your shirts</ref><note xml:id="n067" target="a067"> Reference to the “Shirt of Nessus," which was the piece of clothing given to Hercules by his wife that poisoned and ultimately killed him.

The General came into the same opinion, so that for a long time there was a majority against you. But his Majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the Chamberlain. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal Secretary for Private Affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the Emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein justified the good thoughts you have of him. <pb n="072"/> He allowed your crimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable virtue in a prince, and for which his Majesty was so justly celebrated. He said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the world, that perhaps the most honorable board might think him partial: however, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely offer his sentiments. That if his Majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give order to<ref target="a068" corresp="n068"> put out both your eyes</ref><note xml:id="n068" target="a068"> Possible Biblical allusion to the likewise fates of Zedekiah (Jeremiah 52:11) or Samson (Judges 16:21) Source: (need a source, or should it just be the bible)</note>, he humbly conceived that by this expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the Emperor, as well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honor to be his counsellors. That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his Majesty. That blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us; that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in bringing over the enemy's fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no more. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
<p>This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole board.<ref target="a069" corresp="n069"> Bolgolam</ref><note xml:id="n069" target="a069"> “The last name of Skyresh Bolgolam, the Lilliputian admiral, seems quite clearly to contain the Italian or Spanish gola-" throat" or " gluttony " and the French bol or Italian bolo (or the root of Latin bolus) -bolus, pill, or mouthfull.

Source: http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4172994.pdf?seq=1</note>, the Admiral, could not preserve his temper, but rising up in fury said he wondered how the Secretary dared presume to give his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor: that the services you had performed, were, by all true<ref target="a070" corresp="n070"> reasons of state</ref><note xml:id="n070" target="a070"> A purely political ground of action on the part of a ruler or government, esp. as involving expediency or some departure from strict justice, honesty, or open dealing. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, the great aggravation of <pb n="073"/> your crimes; that you, who were able to extinguish the fire, by discharge of urine in her Majesty's apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might at another time, raise an inundation by the same means, to drown the whole palace; and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy's fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back: that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-Endian in your heart; and as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt acts, so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted you should be put to death. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>The Treasurer was of the same opinion; he showed to what straits his Majesty's revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable: that the Secretary's expedient of putting out your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this evil, it would probably increase it, as it is manifest from the common practice of blinding some kind of fowl, after which they fed the faster, and grew sooner fat: that his sacred Majesty and the Council, who are your judges, were in their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict letter of the law. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>But his Imperial Majesty, fully determined against capital punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the Council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some other may be inflicted hereafter. And your friend the Secretary humbly desiring to be heard again, in answer to what the <pb n="074"/> Treasurer had objected concerning the great charge his Majesty was at in maintaining you, said that his Excellency, who had the sole disposal of the Emperor's revenue, might easily provide against that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which, for want of sufficient food, you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and consequently decay and consume in a few months; neither would the stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death, five or six thousand of his Majesty's subjects might, in two or three days, cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cartloads, and bury it in distant parts to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to posterity. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>Thus by the great friendship of the Secretary, the whole affair was compromised. It was strictly enjoined, that the project of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret, but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting except Bolgolam the Admiral, who, being a creature of the Empress, was perpetually instigated by her Majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual malice against you, on account of that infamous and illegal method you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>In three days your friend the Secretary will be directed to come to your house, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and then to signify the great lenity and favor of his Majesty and Council, whereby you are only condemned to the loss of <pb n="075"/> your eyes, which his Majesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his Majesty's surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid suspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>His Lordship did so, and I remained alone, under many doubts and perplexities of mind. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very different, as I have been assured, from the practices of former times) that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify the monarch's resentment, or the malice of a favorite, the Emperor always made a speech to his whole Council, expressing his great lenity and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world. This speech was immediately published through the kingdom; nor did anything terrify the people so much as those<ref target="a071" corresp="n071"> encomiums on his Majesty's mercy</ref><note xml:id="n071" target="a071"> Allusions to King George I's speeches about his treatment of Jacobite rebels, where he talks about the “numerous instances of mercy which [he has] shown." Source: Swift's Politics: A Study in Disaffection by Ian Higgins</note>; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. And as to myself, I must confess, having never been designed for a courtier either by my birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not discover the lenity and favor of this sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes thought of standing my trial, for <pb n="076"/> although I could not deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some extenuations. But having in my life perused many state trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct, I dared not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies. Once I was strongly bent upon resistance, for while I had liberty, the whole strength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, the favors I received from him, and the high title of Nardac he conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself that his Majesty's present severities quitted me of all past obligations. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>At last I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving of my eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want of experience: because if I had then known the nature of princes and ministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should with great alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment. But hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his Imperial Majesty's license to pay my attendance upon the Emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter <pb n="077"/> to my friend the Secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning Blefuscu pursuant to the leave I had got; and without waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my coverlet, which I brought under my arm) into the vessel, and drawing it after me between wading and swimming, arrived at the royal port of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me; they lent me two guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name. I held them in my hands till I came within two hundred yards of the gate, and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his Majesty's commands. I had an answer in about an hour, that his Majesty, attended by the Royal Family, and great officers of the court, was coming out to receive me. I advanced a hundred yards. The Emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the Empress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were in any fright or concern. I lay on the ground to kiss his Majesty's and the Empress's hand. I told his Majesty that I had come according to my promise, and with the license of the Emperor, my master, to have the honor of seeing so mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent with my duty to my own prince; not mentioning a word of my disgrace, because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose myself wholly ignorant of any <pb n="078"/> such design; neither could I reasonably conceive that the Emperor would discover the secret while I was out of his power: wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and bed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet. </p>

    <lb/>
    
<p>Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off, in the sea, something that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and stockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might, by some tempest, have been driven from a ship; whereupon I returned immediately towards the city, and desired his Imperial Majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had left after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen under the command of his Vice-Admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast where I first discovered the boat; I found the tide had driven it still <pb n="079"/> nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the forepart of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found all my labor to little purpose; for being out of my depth, I was not able to work. In this necessity, I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat forwards as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide favoring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat another shove, and so on till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits; and now the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastening them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being favorable, the seamen towed, and I shoved till we arrived within forty yards of the shore; and waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little damaged. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under by the help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight <pb n="080"/> of so prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way, to carry me to some place from whence I might return into my native country, and begged his Majesty's orders for getting materials to fit it up, together with his license to depart; which, after some kind expostulations, he was pleased to grant. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any express relating to me from our Emperor to the court of Blefuscu. But I was afterwards given privately to understand, that his Imperial Majesty, never imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the license he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would return in a few days when that ceremony was ended. But he was at last in pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the Treasurer, and the rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles against me. This envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of Blefuscu the great lenity of his master, who was content to punish me no farther than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled from justice, and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of my title of Nardac, and declared a traitor. The envoy further added, that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires, his master expected, that his <pb n="081"/> brother of Blefuscu would give orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished as a traitor. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>The Emperor of Blefuscu having taken three days to consult, returned an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, that as for sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for many good offices I had done him in making the peace. That however both their Majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given order to fit up with my own assistance and direction; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable an incumbrance. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch of Blefuscu related to me all that had past, offering me at the same time (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection, if I would continue in his service; wherein although I believed him sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgements for his favorable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused. I told him that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself in the ocean, rather than be an occasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs. Neither did I find the Emperor at all displeased; and I discovered <pb n="082"/> by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his ministers. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen fold of their strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making ropes and cables, by twisting ten, twenty or thirty of the thickest and strongest of theirs. A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I had the<ref target="a072" corresp="n072"> tallow</ref><note xml:id="n072" target="a072"> The fat of adipose tissue of an animal. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of three hundred cows for greasing my boat, and other uses. I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his Majesty's ship carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after I had done the rough work. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his Majesty's commands, and to take my leave. The Emperor and Royal Family came out of the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very graciously gave me: so did the Empress and young Princes of the blood. His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred sprugs apiece, together with his picture at full length, which I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at this time. <pb n="083"/> </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means permit; and besides a diligent search into my pockets, his Majesty engaged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, although with their own consent and desire. </p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> 
    <p>Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the twenty-fourth day of September, 1701, at six in the morning; and when I had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at southeast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about half a league to the northwest. I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the leeside of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took some refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and I conjecture at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favorable, I steered the same course that I had done the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands, which I had reason to believe lay to the northeast <pb n="084"/> of Van Diemen's Land. I discovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the southeast; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out her<ref target="a073" corresp="n073"> ancient</ref><note xml:id="n073" target="a073"> An ensign, standard, or flag. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and discharged a gun. It is not easy to express the joy I was in upon the unexpected hope of once more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I had left in it. The ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in the evening, September 26; but my heart leaped within me to see her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an English merchantman, returning from Japan by the North and South Seas; the Captain, Mr. John Biddle of Deptford, a very civil man, and an excellent sailor. We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good character to the Captain. This gentleman treated me with kindness, and desired I would let know what place I came from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in few words, but he thought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed my head; whereupon I <pb n="085"/> took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity. I then showed him the gold given me by the Emperor of Blefuscu, together with his Majesty's picture at full length, and some other rarities of that country. I gave him two purses of two hundred sprugs each, and promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow and a sheep big with young. </p> <lb/>

    <p>I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage, which was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in<ref target="a074" corresp="n074"> the Downs</ref><note xml:id="n074" target="a074"> The part of the sea within the Goodwin Sands, off the east coast of Kent, a famous rendezvous for ships.

I had only one misfortune, that the rats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked clean from the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe on shore, and set them grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a voyage, if the Captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their constant food. The short time I continued in England, I made considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality, and others: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six hundred pounds. Since my last return, I find the breed is considerably increased, especially the sheep; which I hope will prove much to the advantage of the woollen manufacture, by the<ref target="a075" corresp="n075"> fineness of the fleeces</ref><note xml:id="n075" target="a075"> Swift actually blamed England for encroaching upon Ireland's wool production, as he claims they convinced Ireland to only produce raw wool instead of turning the wool into valuable cloth for exportation.

    <p>I stayed but two months with my wife and family; for my insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer. I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house at Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money, and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes. My eldest uncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty pounds a year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger of<ref target="a076" corresp="n076"> leaving my family upon the parish</ref><note xml:id="n076" target="a076"> The parish at this time, acting as the basic unit of local government, collected funds that were dispersed to the poor as needed.

<p>Having been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and

in the Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a <ref target="c0025" corresp="n0025">Cornishman</ref><note xml:id="n0025" target="c0025">A man from the Southwest county of Cornwall in the United Kingdom. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, Commander,

passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward of that 
island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the winds, which 
in those seas are observed to blow a 
<pb n="088"/> 
constant equal gale between the 
north and west from the beginning of December to the beginning of May, 
on the 19th of April began to blow with much greater violence, and 
more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty days together, 
during which time we were driven a little to the east of the <ref target="c0027" corresp="n0027">Molucca Islands</ref><note xml:id="n0027" target="c0027">The Molucca Islands is a collection of islands west of New Guinea.

ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little 
rejoiced. But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of 
those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly 
happened the day following: for a southern wind, called the southern 
monsoon, began to set in.

stood by to hand the foresail; but making foul weather, we looked 
the guns were all fast, and handed the mizzen. The ship lay very broad 
off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or 
hulling. We reefed the foresail and set him, we hauled aft the 
foresheet; the helm was hard aweather. The ship wore bravely. We 
belayed the fore-down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down 
the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things 
clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and 
dangerous. We hauled off upon the lanyard of the whipstaff, and helped 
the man at helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, 
because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the 
topmast 
<pb n="089"/> 
being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better 
way through the sea, seeing we had sea room. When the storm was 
over, we set foresail and mainsail, and brought the ship to: then we 
set the mizzen, main-topsail, and the fore-topsail. Our course was 
east northeast, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard 
tacks aboard; we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in 
the leebraces, and hauled forward by the weatherbowlings, and hauled 
them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen tack to 
windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie. 
</p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> <p>During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west 
southwest, we were carried by my computation about five hundred 
leagues to the east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell 
in what part of the world we were. Our provisions held out well, our 
ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the 
utmost distress for water. We thought it best to hold on the same 
course, rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us 
to the northwest parts of Great Tartary, and into the frozen sea.

On the 17th we came in full view of a great island or continent (for 
we knew not which) on the south side whereof was a small neck of 
land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a 
ship of above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this 
creek, and our Captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the 
<ref target="c0029" corresp="n0029">longboat</ref><note xml:id="n0029" target="c0029">A longboat is one of the many boats that were carried along bigger sailing ships, such as a man-of-war ship. Longboats were ships that were manned by men with oars (usally about eight or ten men), and were used to bring sailors from the main ship to the beach, as often the main ship was too big to dock by the beach. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, with vessels for water if 
<pb n="090"/> 
any could be found. I desired 
his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what 
discoveries I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring, 
nor any sign of inhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore 
to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about 
a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren 
and rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my 
curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being 
full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing 
for life to the ship. I was going to halloo after them, although it 
had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking 
after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper 
than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start 
of him half a league, and the sea thereabouts being full of 
sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat. 
This I was afterwards told, for I dared not stay to see the issue of 
that adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and 
then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the 
country. I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised 
me was the length of the grass, which in those grounds that seemed 
to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to 
the inhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I 
walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it 
<pb n="091"/> 
being 
now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an 
hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a 
hedge of at least <ref target="c0030" corresp="n0030">one hundred and twenty feet high</ref><note xml:id="n0030" target="c0030">To give some reference as to the size of the hedge, the Americain footabl field is about 160 feet wide. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americain_football_field</note>, and the trees so 
lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude. There was 
a <ref target="c0031" corresp="n0031">stile</ref><note xml:id="n0031" target="c0031">A structure of steps that allows for passage over fences and hedges. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, 
and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was 
impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six feet 
high, and the upper stone above twenty. I was endeavoring to find some 
gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next 
field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I 
saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary 
spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as 
I could guess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and 
ran to hide myself in the corn, from whence I saw him at the top of 
the stile, looking back into the next field on the right hand, and 
heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking trumpet: 
but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly 
thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters like himself came 
towards him with reaping hooks in their hands, each hook about the 
size of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the 
first, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be. For upon some 
words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I 
kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to 
move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks 
<pb n="092"/> 
of the corn were 
sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze 
my body between them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I 
came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain 
and wind. Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the 
stalks were so interwoven that I could not creep through, and the 
beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced 
through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers 
not above a hundred yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil, 
and wholly overcome by grief and despair, I lay down between two 
ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I bemoaned my 
desolate widow, and fatherless children. I lamented my own folly and 
willfulness in attempting a second voyage against the advice of all my 
friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of mind I could 
not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me 
as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was 
able to draw an Imperial Fleet in my hand, and perform those other 
actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that 
empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested 
by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to 
appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian 
would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least of my 
misfortunes: for as human creatures are observed to be more savage and 
cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a 
morsel in the 
<pb n="093"/> 
mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians 
that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the 
right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise 
than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune to let the 
Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive 
with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that 
even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in 
some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery? 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with 
these reflections, when one of the reapers approaching within ten 
yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next 
step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two 
with his reaping hook. And therefore when he was again about to 
move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me. Whereupon the huge 
creature trod short, and looking round about under him for some 
time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground. He considered a 
while with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold on a small 
dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either 
to scratch or to bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a 
weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me up behind by the 
middle between his forefinger and thumb, and brought me within three 
yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly. I 
guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of 
mind, that I resolved not 
<pb n="094"/> 
to struggle in the least as he held me in 
the air about sixty feet from the ground, although he <ref target="c0032" corresp="n0032">grievously</ref><note xml:id="n0032" target="c0032">An adjective indicating a high level of severity. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> 
pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I 
ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my hands 
together in a <ref target="c0033" corresp="n0033">supplicating posture</ref><note xml:id="n0033" target="c0033">The act of begging (often used in a religious context) that is often marked by being down on one's knees with palms facing towards the sky. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and to speak some words in a 
humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in. For I 
apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, 
as we usually do any little hateful animal which we have a mind to 
destroy. But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with 
my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, 
much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he 
could not understand them. In the meantime I was not able to forbear 
groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides; 
letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the 
pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning; 
for, lifting up the <ref target="c0034" corresp="n0034">lappet</ref><note xml:id="n0034" target="c0034">Lapel or a flap in a garmet. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of his coat, he put me gently into it, 
and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial 
farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field. 
</p> <lb/>
    <lb/> <p>The farmer having (as I supposed by their talk) received such an 
account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small 
straw, about the size of a walking staff, and therewith lifted up 
the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of 
covering that nature had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a

them (as 
<pb n="095"/> 
I afterwards learned) whether they had ever seen in the 
fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly 
on the ground upon all four, but I got immediately up, and walked 
slowly backwards and forwards, to let those people see I had no intent 
to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to 
observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards 
the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and 
spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out 
of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the 
palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye, to see what it 
was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin 
(which he took out of his sleeve), but could make nothing of it. 
Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I 
took the purse, and opening it, poured all the gold into his palm. 
There were <ref target="c0036" corresp="n0036">six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each</ref><note xml:id="n0036" target="c0036">Whilst the Spanish pieces are most likely gold, the other coins are of lesser value. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, beside twenty 
or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger 
upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then 
another, but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made 
me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my 
pocket, which after offering to him several times, I thought it best 
to do. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature. 
He spoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears 
like that of a water mill, yet his words were articulate enough. 
<pb n="096"/> 
I 
answered as loud as I could, in several languages, and he often laid 
his ear within two yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly 
unintelligible to each other. He then sent his servants to their work, 
and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread 
it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground, with the palm 
upwards, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for 
it was not above a foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey, 
and for fear of falling, laid myself at length upon the 
handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the 
head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his 
house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she 
screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad 
or a spider. However, when she had a while seen my behavior, and how 
well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled, 
and by degrees grew extremely tender of me. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was 
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of an 
husbandman) in a dish of about twenty-four feet in diameter. The 
company were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old 
grandmother. When they sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance 
from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I 
was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge for 
fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, 
<pb n="097"/> 
then crumbled some 
bread on a <ref target="c0037" corresp="n0037">trencher</ref><note xml:id="n0037" target="c0037">A trencher is a flat piece of wood or a flat piece of bread that was used as a plate during the meal. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow, 
took out my knife and fork, and fell to eating, which gave them 
exceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small <ref target="c0038" corresp="n0038">dram cup</ref><note xml:id="n0038" target="c0038">A dram is a unit of measurement defined as about 3.5ml of fluid. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, 
which held about three gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up 
the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most 
respectful manner drank to her ladyship's health, expressing the words 
as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so 
heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise. This liquor 
tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master 
made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the 
table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader 
will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a 
crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt. I got up 
immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I 
took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners) and waving 
it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had gotten no mischief 
by my fall. But advancing forwards toward my master (as I shall 
henceforth call him), his youngest son who sat next him, an <ref target="c0039" corresp="n0039">arch</ref><note xml:id="n0039" target="c0039">Mischevious. Source: Oxford English Dictioanry</note> boy 
of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in 
the air, that I trembled every limb; but his father snatched me from 
him, and at the same time gave him such a <ref target="c0040" corresp="n0040">box on the left ear</ref><note xml:id="n0040" target="c0040">To box someone's ear means to slap them on the side of the head. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, as 
would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering 
him to be taken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe 
me a spite, and well 
<pb n="098"/> 
remembering how mischievous all children among us 
naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I 
fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to 
understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be 
pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again; 
whereupon I went to him and kissed his hand, which my master took, and 
made him stroke me gently with it. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>In the midst of dinner, my mistress' favorite cat leaped into her 
lap. I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers 
at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of 
this animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I 
computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her 
mistress was feeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this 
creature's countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at 
the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off and although my 
mistress held her fast for fear she might give a spring, and seize 
me in her talons. But it happened there was no danger; for the cat 
took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within 
three yards of her. And as I have been always told, and found true 
by experience in my travels, that flying, or discovering fear way to 
make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved in this dangerous juncture 
to show no manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or six 
times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard 
of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she 
<pb n="099"/> 
were more afraid of 
me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four 
came into the room, as it is usual in farmers' houses; one of which 
was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and a greyhound, 
somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a Child of a 
year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall 
that you might have heard from <ref target="c0041" corresp="n0041">London Bridge to Chelsea</ref><note xml:id="n0041" target="c0041">A journey of about five miles. Source: https://www.google.com/maps/</note>, after the

pure indulgence took me up, and put me towards the child, who 
presently seized me by the middle, and got my head in his mouth, where 
I roared so loud that the urchin was frightened, and let me drop; 
and I should infallibly have broken my neck if the mother had not held 
her apron under me. The nurse to quiet her babe made use of a 
rattle, which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, 
and fastened by a cable to the childs waist: but all in vain, so 
that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must 
confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her 
monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to 
give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape and color. It stood 
prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in 
circumference. The nipple was about half the size of my head, and 
the hue both of that and the <ref target="c0043" corresp="n0043">dug</ref><note xml:id="n0043" target="c0043">Nipple. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> so varified with spots, pimples and 
freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near 
sight of her, she 
<pb n="100"/> 
sitting down the more conveniently to give suck, and 
I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair skins of 
our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they 
are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a 
magnifying glass, where we find by experiment that the smoothest and 
whitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill colored. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those 
diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking 
upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate 
friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother 
when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view 
when I took him up in my hand and brought him close, which he 
confessed was at first a very shocking sight. He said he could 
discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were 
ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made 
up of several colors altogether disagreeable: although I must beg 
leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and 
country, and very little sunburned by all my travels. On the other 
side, <ref target="c0044" corresp="n0044">Discoursing</ref><note xml:id="n0044" target="c0044">Speaking of. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> of the ladies in that Emperor's court, he used to 
tell me, one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a third too large 
a nose, nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this 
reflection was obvious enough; which however I could not forbear, lest 
the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed: 
for I must do them justice to say 
<pb n="101"/> 
they are a <ref target="c0045" corresp="n0045">comely</ref><note xml:id="n0045" target="c0045">Attractive or agreeable. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> race of people; 
and particularly the features of my master's countenance, although 
he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet, 
appeared very well proportioned. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When dinner was done, my master went out to his laborers, and as I 
could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife a strict charge 
to take care of me. I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, 
which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered 
me with a clean white handkerchief, larger and coarser than the 
mainsail of a man of war. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife 
and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awakened and found 
myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet 
wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My 
mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in. 
The bed was eight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities 
required me to get down; I dare not presume to call, and if I had, 
it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a 
distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family 
kept. While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the 
curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed. One of 
them came up almost to my face, 
<pb n="102"/> 
whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew 
out my <ref target="c0046" corresp="n0046">hanger</ref><note xml:id="n0046" target="c0046">A short sword. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to defend myself. These horrible animals had the 
boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his 
fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly 
before he could do me any mischief. He fell down at my feet, and the 
other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not 
without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and 
made the blood run trickling from him. After this exploit, I walked 
gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of 
spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but 
infinitely more nimble and fierce, so that if I had taken off my 
belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to 
pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it 
to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my 
stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still 
bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash 
cross the neck, I thoroughly dispatched it. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, 
ran and took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling and 
making other signs to show I was not hurt, whereat she was extremely 
rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of 
tongs, and throw it out of the window. Then she set me on a table, 
where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet 
of my coat, returned it to the scabbard. I was pressed to do more than 
one thing, which 
<pb n="103"/> 
another could not do for me, and therefore endeavored 
to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the 
floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to 
express myself farther than by pointing to the door, and bowing 
several times. The good woman with much difficulty at last perceived 
what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into 
the garden, where she set me down. I went on one side about two 
hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid 
myself between two leaves of sorrel and there discharged the 
necessities of nature. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and 
the like particulars, which however insignificant they may appear to 
grovelling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to 
enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of 
public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting 
this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have 
been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of 
learning or of style. But the whole scene of this voyage made so 
strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my 
memory, that in committing it to paper I did not omit one material 
circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several 
passages of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being 
censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travelers are often, perhaps 
not without justice, accused.

<p>My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of forward 
parts for her age, very dextrous at her needle, and skillful in 
dressing her baby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby's 
cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of 
a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of 
the rats. This was my bed all the time I stayed with those people, 
though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their 
language, and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy, 
that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she 
was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble 
when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts, 
and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed 
was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me 
with her own hands. She was likewise my school mistress to teach me 
the language: when I pointed to anything, she told me the name of it 
in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for 
whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above 
forty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of 
Grildrig, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole 
kingdom. 
<pb n="105"/> 
The word imports what the Latins call <hi rend="italics">nanunculus </hi>the Italians 
<hi rend="italics">homunceletino</hi>, and the English <hi rend="italics">mannikin</hi>. To her I chiefly owe my 
preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I 
called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse: and I should be guilty 
of great ingratitude if I omitted this honorable mention of her care 
and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power 
to <ref target="c0047" corresp="n0047">requite</ref><note xml:id="n0047" target="c0047">To repay. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> as she deserves, instead of being the innocent but 
unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear. 
</p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> <p>It now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that 
my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness 
of a splacknuck, but exactly shaped in every part like a human 
creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to 
speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several 
words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, 
would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the 
finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman's 
daughter of three years old. Another farmer who lived hard by, and was 
a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to 
inquire into the truth of this story. I was immediately produced, 
and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my 
hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master's guest, asked 
him in his own language how he did, and told him he was welcome, 
just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and 
dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold 
<pb n="106"/> 
me better, at which I 
could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like 
the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our people, who 
discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at 
which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of 
countenance. He had the character of a great <ref target="c0048" corresp="n0048">miser</ref><note xml:id="n0048" target="c0048">A miser is someone who is stingy and refues to spend their money even to the detriment of their quality of life. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and to my 
misfortune he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master 
to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town, which was 
half an hour's riding, about twenty-two miles from our house. I 
guessed there was some mischief contriving, when I observed my 
master and his friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing 
at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some 
of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, 
told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from 
her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell weeping 
with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would happen to me 
from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of 
my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also observed how modest 
I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honor, and what an 
indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for money as a public 
spectacle to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma 
had promised that Grildrig should be hers, but now she found they 
meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to 
give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, 
<pb n="107"/> 
sold it to a butcher. 
For my own part, I may truly affirm that I was less concerned than 
my nurse. I had a strong hope which never left me, that I should one 
day recover my liberty; and as to the <ref target="c0049" corresp="n0049">ignominy</ref><note xml:id="n0049" target="c0049">Shame. Source: Oxford English dictionary</note> of being carried 
about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in 
the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me 
as a reproach, if ever I should return to England; since the King of 
Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same 
distress. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master, <ref target="c0050" corresp="n0050">pusuant</ref><note xml:id="n0050" target="c0050">In accordance with. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box

was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, 
and a few <ref target="c0052" corresp="n0052">gimlet</ref><note xml:id="n0052" target="c0052">A gimlet is a tool for boring holes into wood that keeps it from splitting. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful 
to put the quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on. 
However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though 
it were but of half an hour. For the horse went about forty feet at 
every step, and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the 
rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent. 
Our journey was somewhat further than from <ref target="c0053" corresp="n0053">London to St. Albans</ref><note xml:id="n0053" target="c0053">London is about twenty miles away from St. Albans. Source: https://www.google.com/maps/</note>. My 
master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after 
consulting a while with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary 
preparations, he hired the Grultrud, or crier, to give notice  
<pb n="108"/> 
through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the Sign of the 
Green Eagle, not so big as a splacknuck (an animal in that country 
very finely shaped, about six foot long) and in every part of the body 
resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform 
a hundred diverting tricks. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which 
might be near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a 
low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I 
should do. My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty 
people at a time to see me. I walked about on the table as the girl 
commanded: she asked me questions as far as she knew my 
understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud 
as I could. I turned about several times to the company, paid my 
humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other 
speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled with liquor, 
which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health. 
I drew out my hanger, and flourished it after the manner of fencers in 
England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I exercised as a 
pike, having learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown to 
twelve sets of company, and as often forced to go over again with 
the same <ref target="c0054" corresp="n0054">fopperies</ref><note xml:id="n0054" target="c0054">Foolishness. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, till I was half dead with weariness and

that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My 
master for his own interest would not suffer any one to touch me 
except my nurse; and, to prevent danger, 
<pb n="109"/> 
benches were set around the 
table at such a distance as put me out of everybody's reach. 
However, an unlucky schoolboy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head, 
which very narrowly missed me; otherwise, it came with so much 
violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for 
it was almost as large as a small <ref target="c0056" corresp="n0056">pumpion</ref><note xml:id="n0056" target="c0056">A pumpion is an older english word for pumpkin. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>: but I had the 
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the 
room. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next 
market day, and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient 
vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired 
with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours 
together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word. It 
was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I 
might have no rest at home, all the neighboring gentlemen from a 
hundred miles around, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my 
master's own house. There could not be fewer than thirty persons 
with their wives and children (for the country is very populous); 
and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me 
at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some 
time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday, 
which is their Sabbath) although I were not carried to the town. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to 
carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having 
therefore 
<pb n="110"/> 
provided himself with all things necessary for a long 
journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, 
and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my 
arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situated near the middle of 
that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house. 
My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried 
me on her lap in a box tied about her waist. The girl had lined it 
on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted 
underneath, furnished it with her baby's bed, provided me with linen 
and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could. 
We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with 
the luggage. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>My master's design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and

Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with 
the trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own 
desire, to give me air and show me the country, but always held me 
fast by a leading string. We passed over five or six rivers many 
degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there 
was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We 
were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns 
besides many villages and private families. 
<pb n="111"/> 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>On the 26th day of October, we arrived at the metropolis, called 
in their language Lorbrulgrud, or Pride of the Universe. My master 
took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the 
royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact 
description of my person and parts. He hired a large room between 
three and four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in 
diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and <ref target="c0058" corresp="n0058">palisadoed</ref><note xml:id="n0058" target="c0058">Enclosed. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> it around 
three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling 
over. I was shown ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of 
all people. I could now speak the language tolerably well, and 
perfectly understood every word that was spoken to me. Besides, I 
had learned their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a 
sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor 
while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey. She 
carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a <ref target="c0059" corresp="n0059">Sanson's Atlas</ref><note xml:id="n0059" target="c0059">Nicholas Sanson was a French cartographer who created multiple atlas.

<p>The frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very 
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the 
more unsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost 
reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I soon 
must die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While 
he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a Slardral, or 
Gentleman Usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me 
immediately thither for the diversion of the Queen and her ladies. 
Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange 
things of my beauty, behavior, and good sense. Her Majesty and those 
who attended her were beyond measure delighted with my demeanor. I 
fell on my knees, and begged the honor of kissing her Imperial foot; 
but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me 
(after I was set on a table) which I embraced in both my arms, and put 
the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some 
<pb n="113"/> 
general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as 
distinctly and in as few words as I could. She asked whether I would 
be content to live at court. I bowed down to the board of the table, 
and humbly answered, that I was my master's slave, but if I were at my 
own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her Majesty's 
service. She then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me 
at a good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was 
ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of 
gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the 
bigness of eight hundred <ref target="c0060" corresp="n0060">moidores</ref><note xml:id="n0060" target="c0060">Portugese gold coins. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; but, allowing for the proportion of 
all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold 
among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand <ref target="c0061" corresp="n0061">guineas</ref><note xml:id="n0061" target="c0061">British gold coins. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> would be 
in England. I then said to the Queen, since I was now her Majesty's 
most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favor, that 
Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and 
kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into 
her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor. Her Majesty 
agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer's consent, who was 
glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court: and the poor girl 
herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew, bidding 
me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I 
replied not a word, only making him a slight bow. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen observed my coldness, and when the farmer was gone out 
of the apartment, asked me 
<pb n="114"/> 
the reason. I made bold to tell her Majesty 
that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not 
dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance 
in his field; which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he 
had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he 
had now sold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious 
enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength. That my health 
was much impaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble 
every hour of the day, and that if my master had not thought my life 
in danger, her Majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap a 
bargain. But as I was out of all fear of being ill treated under the 
protection of so great and good an Empress, the Ornament of Nature, 
the Darling of the World, the Delight of her Subjects, the Phoenix 
of the Creation; so I hoped my late master's apprehensions would 
appear to be groundless, for I already found my spirits to revive by 
the influence of her most august presence. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great <ref target="c0062" corresp="n0062">improprieties</ref><note xml:id="n0062" target="c0062">Improper language. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> 
and hesitation; the latter part was altogether framed in the style 
peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from 
Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, 
was however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive 
an animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the King, 
who was then retired to his cabinet. His Majesty, a prince of much 
gravity, 
<pb n="115"/> 
and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first 
view, asked the Queen after a cold manner, how long it was since she 
grew fond of a splacknuck; for such it seems he took me to be, as I 
lay upon my breast in her Majesty's right hand. But this princess, who 
has an infinite deal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon 
the <ref target="c0063" corresp="n0063">scrutore</ref><note xml:id="n0063" target="c0063">A writing desk. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and commanded me to give his Majesty an account of 
myself, which I did in a very few words; and Glumdalclitch, who 
attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out 
of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my 
arrival at her father's house. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King, although he be as learned a person as any in his 
dominions, and had been educated in the study of philosophy, and 
particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and 
saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a 
piece of clockwork (which is in that country arrived to a very great 
perfection), contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard 
my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he 
could not conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied 
with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, 
but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, 
who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a higher price. 
Upon this imagination he put several other questions to me, and 
still received rational answers, no otherwise defective than by a 
foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with 
some rustic 
<pb n="116"/> 
phrases which I had learned at the farmer's house, and did 
not suit the polite style of a court. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>His Majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their 
weekly <ref target="c0064" corresp="n0064">waiting</ref><note xml:id="n0064" target="c0064">Attendance at court. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, according to the custom in that country. These 
gentlemen, after they had awhile examined my shape with much nicety, 
were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could 
not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was 
not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, 
or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed 
by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a 
carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and 
field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I 
should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other 
insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to <ref target="c0065" corresp="n0065">evince</ref><note xml:id="n0065" target="c0065">To reveal or indicate. Source Oxford English Dictionary</note> that 
I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that 
I might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected 
by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished, 
and that I had lived several years, as it was manifested from my 
beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying 
glass. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness 
<pb n="117"/> 
was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the Queen's favorite 
dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was nearly thirty feet 
high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only 
<hi rend="italics">relplum scalcath</hi>, which is interpreted literally, <ref target="c0067" corresp="n0067"><hi rend="italics">lusus naturae</hi></ref><note xml:id="n0067" target="c0067">"Lusus naturae" is Latin for freak-of-nature. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; a 
determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe, 
whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby 
the followers of Artistotle endeavor in vain to disguise their 
ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all 
difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or 
two. I applied myself to the King, and assured his Majesty, that I 
came from a country which abounded with several millions of both 
sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses 
were all in proportion, and where by consequence I might be as able to 
defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his Majesty's 
subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those 
gentlemen's arguments. To this they only replied with a smile of 
contempt, saying that the farmer had instructed me very well in my 
lesson. The King, who had a much better understanding, dismissing 
his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not 
yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately, 
and then confronted him with me and the young girl, 
<pb n="118"/> 
his Majesty 
began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He 
desired the Queen to order that a particular care should be taken of 
me, and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her 
office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for 
each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court; 
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a 
maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but 
the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The Queen commanded 
her own cabinet maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a 
bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree 
upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my 
directions, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen 
feet square, and twelve high, with <ref target="c0068" corresp="n0068">sash windows</ref><note xml:id="n0068" target="c0068">A sash window is a window that has movable panels; these windows are still in popular use today. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, a door, and two 
closets, like a London bedchamber. The board that made the ceiling was 
to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready 
furnished by her Majesty's upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out 
every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at 
night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous 
for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs 
and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a 
cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as 
well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the 
carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt 
when I went in a coach. I desired 
<pb n="119"/> 
a lock for my door, to prevent 
rats and mice from coming in: the smith, after several attempts, 
made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a 
larger at the gate of a gentleman's house in England. I made a shift 
to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might 
lose it. The Queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be 
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English 
blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them. They were 
after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and 
partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine 
without me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty 
ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch 
stood upon a stool on the floor, near my table, to assist and take 
care of me. I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other 
necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the Queen, were not much 
bigger than what I have seen of the same kind in a London toy shop, 
for the furniture of a babyhouse: these my little nurse kept in her 
pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them, 
always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the Queen but the 
two Princesses Royal, the elder sixteen years old, and the younger 
at that time thirteen and a month. Her Majesty used to put a bit of 
meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and 
her diversion was to see me eat in miniature. For the Queen (who had 
indeed 
<pb n="120"/> 
but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a 
dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some 
time a very nauseous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark, bones 
and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as 
that of a full grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth, as 
big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a 
hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set 
straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments 
were all in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried 
me out of curiosity to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a 
dozen of these enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I 
thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>It is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have before 
observed, was their Sabbath) the King and Queen, with the royal 
issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his Majesty, to 
whom I was now become a great favorite; and at these times my little 
chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt 
cellars. This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me, 
inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning 
of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able. His 
apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made 
very wise reflections and observations upon all I said. But, I 
confess, that after I had been a little too copious in talking of my 
own beloved country, 
<pb n="121"/> 
of our trade, and wars by sea and land, of our 
schisms in religion, and parties in the state, the prejudices of his 
education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up 
in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after an 
hearty fit of laughing, asked me whether I were <ref target="c0069" corresp="n0069">a Whig or a Tory</ref><note xml:id="n0069" target="c0069">Whigs and Tories were opposing factions in the British Parliament from the 1680's to the 1850's. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. Then 
turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white 
staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he 
observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be 
mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, said he, I dare 
engage, these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor, 
they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and 
cities; they make a figure in dress and <ref target="c00700" corresp="n0070">equipage</ref><note xml:id="n0070" target="c0070">Equipment. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>; they love, they 
fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray. And thus he continued 
on, while <ref target="c0071" corresp="n0071">my color came and went several times with indignation</ref><note xml:id="n0071" target="c0071">Indignation is defined as anger towards a misunderstanding or mistreatment.

and truth, the pride and envy of the world, contemptuously treated. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so, upon 
mature thoughts, I began to doubt whether I were injured or not. 
For, after having been 
<pb n="122"/> 
accustomed several months to the sight and 
converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast 
my eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had first 
conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I 
had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their 
finery and best day clothes, acting their several parts in the most 
courtly manner, of strutting, and bowing, and <ref target="c0073" corresp="n0073">prating</ref><note xml:id="n0073" target="c0073">Talking foolishly. Source Oxford English Dictionary</note>, to say the 
truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as 
the King and his grandees did at me. Neither indeed could I forbear 
smiling at myself, when the Queen used to place me upon her hand 
towards a <ref target="c0074" corresp="n0074">looking glass</ref><note xml:id="n0074" target="c0074">A mirror. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, by which both our persons appeared before 
me in full view together! and there could be nothing more ridiculous 
than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled 
many degrees below my usual size. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the Queen's dwarf, who 
being of the lowest stature that was ever that country (for I verily 
think he was not thirty feet high) became insolent at seeing a 
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger 
and look big as he passed by me in the Queen's antechamber, while I 
was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the 
court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; 
against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, 
challenging him to wrestle, and such <ref target="c0075" corresp="n0075">repartees</ref><note xml:id="n0075" target="c0075">Witty remarks and conversations. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> as are usual in the 
mouths of court pages. One day at dinner this malicious little cub was  
<pb n="123"/> 
so nettled with something I had said to him, that raising himself upon 
the frame of her Majesty's chair, he took me up by the middle, as I 
was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a 
large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I 
fell over head and ears, and if I had not been a good swimmer, it 
might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant 
happened to be at the other end of the room, and the Queen was in such 
a fright that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my 
little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had 
swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; however, I 
received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was 
utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a farther 
punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream, into which he had 
thrown me; neither was he ever restored to favor; for soon after the 
Queen bestowed him to a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no 
more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what 
extremity such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>He had before served me a <ref target="c0076" corresp="n0076">scurvy</ref><note xml:id="n0076" target="c0076">Contemptible. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> trick, which set the Queen a

to intercede. Her Majesty had taken a marrow bone upon her plate, 
and after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish 
erect as it stood before; the dwarf watching his opportunity, while 
Glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard, 
<pb n="124"/> 
mounted upon the stool she 
stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and 
squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above 
my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous 
figure. I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was 
become of me, for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes 
seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings 
and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf at my <ref target="c0078" corresp="n0078">entreaty</ref><note xml:id="n0078" target="c0078">Request. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> had no other 
punishment than a sound whipping. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was frequently <ref target="c0079" corresp="n0079">rallied</ref><note xml:id="n0079" target="c0079">"Good-humored" banter. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> by the Queen upon account of my 
fearfulness, and she used to ask me whether the people of my 
country were as great cowards as myself. The occasion was this. The 
kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious 
insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any 
rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing 
about my ears. They would sometimes alight upon my victuals; and leave 
their loathsome excrement or spawn behind, which to me was very 
visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics 
were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they 
would fix upon my nose or forehead, where they stung me to the 
quick, smelling very offensively, and I could easily trace that 
viscous matter, which our naturalists tell us enables those 
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much 
ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not 
forbear starting when they came on 
<pb n="125"/> 
my face. It was the common practice 
of the dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as 
schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on 
purpose to frighten me, and divert the Queen. My remedy was to cut 
them in pieces with my knife as they flew in the air, wherein my 
dexterity was much admired. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I remember one morning when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box 
upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I 
dared not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the 
window, as we do with cages in England) after I had lifted up one of 
my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for 
my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying 
into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes. 
Some of them seized my cake, and carried it <ref target="c0080" corresp="n0080">piecemeal</ref><note xml:id="n0080" target="c0080">Piece by piece. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> away, others 
flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and 
putting me in the utmost terror of their stings. However I had the 
courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air. I 
dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut 
my window. These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their 
stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles. I 
carefully preserved them all, and having since shown them with some 
other curiosities in several parts of Europe, upon my return to 
England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth 
for myself.

<p>I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, 
as far as I traveled in it, which was not above two thousand miles 
round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the Queen, whom I always 
attended, never went further when she accompanied the King in his 
progresses, and there stayed until his Majesty returned from viewing 
his frontiers. The whole extent of this prince's dominions reaches 
about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth. 
From whence I cannot but conclude that our geographers of Europe are 
in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and 
California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance 
of earth to <ref target="c0081" corresp="n0081">counterpoise</ref><note xml:id="n0081" target="c0081">Oppose.

they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast 
tract of land to the northwest parts of America, wherein I shall be 
ready to lend them my assistance. 
</p> <lb/> 
    <lb/> <p>The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge 
of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable by 
reason of the volcanoes upon the tops. Neither do the most learned 
know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether 
they be inhabited at all. 
<pb n="127"/> 
On the three other sides it is bounded by 
the ocean. There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom, and those 
parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed 
rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with 
the smallest of their boats, so that these people are wholly 
excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world. But the large 
rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish, for they 
seldom get any from the sea because the sea fish are of the same 
size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching; 
whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and 
animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this 
continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by 
philosophers. However, now and then they take a whale that happens 
to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on 
heartily. These whales I have known so large that a man could hardly 
carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes for curiosity they are 
brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud: I saw one of them in a dish at 
the King's table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe 
he was fond of it; for I think indeed the bigness disgusted him, 
although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, 
near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To 
satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe 
Lorbrulgrud. This city stands upon almost two equal parts on each side 
the river that passes through. It contains 
<pb n="128"/> 
above eighty thousand 
houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length 
three glonglungs (which make about fifty-four English miles) and two 
and a half in breadth, as I measured it myself in the royal map made 
by the King's order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me, 
and extended a hundred feet; I paced the diameter and circumference 
several times barefoot, and computing by the scale, measured it pretty 
exactly. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King's palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of building 
about seven miles around: the chief rooms are generally two hundred 
and forty feet high, and broad and long proportion. A coach was 
allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took 
her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of 
the party, carried in my box; although the girl at my own desire would 
often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more 
conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the 
streets. I reckoned our coach to be about a square of <ref target="c0083" corresp="n0083">Westminster Hall</ref><note xml:id="n0083" target="c0083">A meeting place for the two houses of parliament. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, but not altogether so high; however, I cannot be very exact. One 
day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where 
the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the 
coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacles that ever an English 
eye beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled 
to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could 
have easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow 
with a <ref target="c0084" corresp="n0084">wen</ref><note xml:id="n0084" target="c0084">A cyst. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> in his neck, larger than five <ref target="c0085" corresp="n0085">wool-packs</ref><note xml:id="n0085" target="c0085">Bags of wool bagged for sale. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and another 
<pb n="129"/> 
with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the 
most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes. I 
could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much 
better than those of an European <ref target="c0086" corresp="n0086">louse</ref><note xml:id="n0086" target="c0086">A parasitic insect. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> through a microscope, and their

ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of 
them, if I had proper instruments (which I unluckily left behind me in 
the shop) although indeed the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly 
turned my stomach. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the Queen 
ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet 
square, and ten high, for the convenience of traveling, because the 
other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome 
in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the 
whole contrivance. This traveling closet was an exact square with a 
window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was 
latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long 
journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong 
staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I 
had a mind to be on horseback, put in a leathern belt, and buckled 
it about his waist. This was always the office of some grave trusty 
servant in whom I could confide, whether I attended the King and Queen 
in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a 
visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when 
<pb n="130"/> 
Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order: for I soon began to be 
known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon 
account of their Majesties' favor, than any merit of my own. In 
journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback 
would buckle my box, and place it on a cushion before him; and there I 
had a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three 
windows. I had in this closet a field bed and a hung from the ceiling, 
two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent 
being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And 
having been long used to sea voyages, those motions, although 
sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my traveling 
closet, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open <ref target="c0088" corresp="n0088">sedan</ref><note xml:id="n0088" target="c0088">A vehicle. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, 
after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by 
two others in the Queen's <ref target="c0089" corresp="n0089">livery</ref><note xml:id="n0089" target="c0089">Dress or uniform. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>. The people who had often heard of 
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was 
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her 
hand that I might be more conveniently seen. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the 
tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom. 
Accordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly 
say I came back disappointed; for height is not above three thousand 
feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which 
allowing for 
<pb n="131"/> 
the difference between the size of those people and us in 
Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in 
proportion (if I rightly remember) to <ref target="c0090" corresp="n0090">Salisbury steeple</ref><note xml:id="n0090" target="c0090">The steeple at the Salisbury Cathedral is 404 feet tall. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbuy_Cathedral</note>. But, not to 
detract from a nation to which during my life I shall acknowledge 
myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous 
tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength. For the 
walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each 
is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of 
gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life, placed in 
their several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down 
from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and 
found it exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch 
wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket 
to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as 
children at her age usually are. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King's kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and 
about six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten 
yards as the <ref target="c0091" corresp="n0091">cupola at St. Paul's</ref><note xml:id="n0091" target="c0091">The diameter of the cupola, or dome of St. Paul's Cathedral is 112 feet. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral</note>; for I measured the latter on 
purpose after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate, 
the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the 
spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly 
believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged 
a little, as travelers are often suspected to do. To avoid which 
censure, I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that 
if this treatise should happen to be translated into the 
<pb n="132"/> 
language of 
Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom) and 
transmitted thither, the King and his people would have reason to 
complain that I had done them an injury by a false and diminutive 
representation. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>His Majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: 
they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he 
goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended for state by a militia 
guard of five hundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most 
splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his 
army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.

<p>I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness 
had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents, 
some of which I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried 
me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would 
sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand, or set me down to 
walk. I remember, before the dwarf left the Queen, he followed us 
one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and 
I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show 
my wit by a silly allusion between him and the trees, 
<pb n="133"/> 
which happens to 
hold in their language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious 
rogue watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of 
them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of 
them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; 
one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me 
down flat on my face, but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf 
was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Another day Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert 
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the 
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was 
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground: and when I was 
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if 
I had been pelted with tennis balls; however, I made a shift to 
creep on all fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the 
lee side of a border of lemon thyme, but so bruised from head to 
foot that I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to 
be wondered at, because nature in that country observing the same 
proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen 
hundred times as large as one in Europe, which I can assert upon 
experience, having been so curious to weigh and measure them. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, 
when my little nurse believing 
<pb n="134"/> 
she had put me in a secure place, (which 
I often entreated her to do, that might enjoy my own thoughts) and 
having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went 
to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of 
her acquaintance. While she was absent and out of hearing, a small 
white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners, having got by 
accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I 
lay. The dog following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in 
his mouth, ran straight to his master, wagging his tail, and set me 
gently on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that 
I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even 
tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a 
great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright. He gently took me 
up in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed 
and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I 
came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who by this 
time had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel 
agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called: she 
severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing 
was hushed up, and never known at court; for the girl was afraid of 
the Queen's anger, and truly as to myself, I thought it would not be 
for my reputation that such a story should go about. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust 
me abroad for the future out 
<pb n="135"/> 
of her sight. I had been long afraid of 
this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little 
unlucky adventures that happened in those times when I was left by 
myself. Once a kite hovering over the garden made a swoop at me, and 
if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick 
<ref target="c0093" corresp="n0093">espalier</ref><note xml:id="n0093" target="c0093">A shrub. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons. 
Another time walking to the top of a fresh molehill, I fell to my neck 
in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth, and 
coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for 
spoiling my clothes. I likewise broke my right shin against the 
shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking 
alone, and thinking on poor England. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified, to observe 
in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at 
all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard's distance, 
looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and 
security as if no creature at all were near them. I remember a 
thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a 
piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. 
When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn 
against me, endeavoring to pick my fingers, which I dared not 
venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned 
to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day I took 
a thick <ref target="c0094" corresp="n0094">cudgel</ref><note xml:id="n0094" target="c0094">A stick used for beating, similar to a club. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, and threw it with all my strength so luckily at a 
<ref target="c0095" corresp="n0095">linnet</ref><note xml:id="n0095" target="c0095">A type of finch. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_linnet</note> that I knocked him down, and seizing 
<pb n="136"/> 
him by the neck with 
both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird, 
who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave me so many boxes 
with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at 
arm's length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty 
times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by one of our 
servants, who wrung off the bird's neck, and I had him next day for 
dinner, by the Queen's command. This as near as I can remember, to 
be somewhat larger than an English swan. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Maids of Honor often invited Glumdalclitch to their 
apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on 
purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would 
often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in 
their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted; because, to say the 
truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not 
mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for 
whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was 
more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those 
illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to 
each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England. 
And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more 
supportable than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately 
swooned away. I cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in 
Lilliput took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal 
of exercise, to 
<pb n="137"/> 
complain of a strong smell about me, although I am 
as little faulty that way as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty 
of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this 
people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the Queen 
my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet 
as those of any lady in England. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>That which gave me most uneasiness among these Maids of Honor, 
when my nurse carried me to visit them, was to see them use me without 
any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of 
consequence. For they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on 
their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet 
directly before their naked bodies, which, I am sure, to me was very 
far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other 
emotions than those of horror and disgust. Their skins appeared so 
coarse and uneven, so variously colored, when I saw them near, with 
a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from 
it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing further concerning the 
rest of their persons. Neither did they at all <ref target="c0096" corresp="n0096">scruple</ref><note xml:id="n0096" target="c0096">Hesitate. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note>, while I was 
by, to discharge what they had drunk, to the quantity of at least 
two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tons. The 
handsomest among these Maids of Honor, a pleasant frolicsome girl of 
sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, 
with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not 
being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I 
entreated Glumdalclitch 
<pb n="138"/> 
to contrive some excuse for not seeing that 
young lady any more. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>One day a young gentleman, who was a nephew to my nurse's governess, 
came and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man who 
had murdered one of that gentleman's intimate acquaintance. 
Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against 
her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted; and as for 
myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my 
curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be 
extraordinary. The <ref target="c0097" corresp="n0097">malefactor</ref><note xml:id="n0097" target="n0097">A criminal. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold 
erected for the purpose, and his head cut off at a blow with a sword 
of about forty foot long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a 
prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great 
<ref target="c0098" corresp="n0098">jet d'eau at Versailles</ref><note xml:id="n0098" target="c0098">"Jet d'eau" is french for water jet. At the Palace of Versailles there are many fountains that contain water jets. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was not equal for the time it lasted; and 
the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce, as 
made me start, although I were at least half an English mile distant. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The Queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages, and 
took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me 
whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a 
little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health. I 
answered that I understood both very well. For, although my proper 
employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet upon a 
pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see 
how this could be 
<pb n="139"/> 
done in their country, where the smallest <ref target="c0099" corresp="n0099">wherry</ref><note xml:id="n0099" target="c0099">A rowboat for carrying passengers. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> was 
equal to a first-rate man of war among us, and such a boat as I 
could manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her Majesty 
said, if I would contrive a boat, her own <ref target="c0100" corresp="n0100">joiner</ref><note xml:id="n0100" target="c0100">A wood craftsman. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> should make it, and 
she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an 
ingenious workman, and by my instructions in ten days finished a 
pleasure boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight 
Europeans. When it was finished, the Queen was so delighted, that 
she ran with it in her lap to the King, who ordered it to be put in 
a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial; where I could 
not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the 
Queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner 
to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and 
eight deep; which being well pitched to prevent leaking, was placed on 
the floor along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a 
cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale, 
and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often 
used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the Queen and her 
ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and 
agility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was 
only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and 
when they were weary, some of the pages would blow my sail forward 
with their breath, while I showed my art steering starboard or 
larboard as I pleased. When I had 
<pb n="140"/> 
done, Glumdalclitch always carried 
my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>In this exercise I once met an accident which had like to have 
cost me my life. For one of the pages having put my boat into the 
trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously 
lifted me up to place me in the boat, but I happened to slip through 
her fingers, and should have infallibly fallen down forty feet upon 
the floor, if by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been 
stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman's 
stomacher; the head of the pin passed between my shirt and the 
waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air 
till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my 
trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless to let a huge 
frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay 
concealed till I was put into my boat, but then seeking a resting 
place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was 
forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent 
overturning. When the frog got in, it hopped at once half the length 
of the boat, and then over my head, backwards and forwards, daubing my 
face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its 
features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be 
conceived. However, I desired Glumdaclitch to let me deal with it 
alone. I 
<pb n="141"/> 
banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last 
forced it to leap out of the boat. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from 
a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. 
Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere 
upon business or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet 
window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger 
box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and 
conveniency. As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard 
something bounce in at the closet window, and skip about from one side 
to the other; whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured 
to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and then I saw this 
frolicsome animal, frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he 
came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and 
curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to the 
farther corner of my room, or box, but the monkey looking in at 
every side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted presence of 
mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done. 
After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last 
espied me, and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat 
does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to 
avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made 
of that country cloth, was very thick and strong) and dragged me 
out. He took me up in his right forefoot, and held me as a nurse 
does a child she is going to suckle, 
<pb n="142"/> 
just as I have seen the same sort 
of creature do with a kitten in Europe: and when I offered to 
struggle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to 
submit. I have good to believe that he took me for a young one of 
his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his 
other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the 
closet door, as if somebody were opening it; whereupon he suddenly 
leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the 
leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the 
fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I 
heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me 
out. The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace 
was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was 
seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, 
holding me like a baby in one of his fore-paws, and feeding me with 
the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out 
of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not 
eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing; 
neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for without 
question the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself. Some 
of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but 
this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably my brains had 
been dashed out. 
<pb n="143"/> 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men, which 
the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not 
being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on 
a ridge tile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time three 
hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down 
by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over 
and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my 
nurse's footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches 
pocket, brought me down safe. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed 
down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth 
with a small needle, and then I fell to vomiting, which gave me 
great relief. Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the 
squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep 
my bed a fortnight. The King, Queen, and all the court, sent every day 
to inquire after my health, and her Majesty made me several visits 
during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an order made that no 
such animal should be kept about the palace. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>When I attended the King after my recovery, to return him thanks for 
his favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this 
adventure. He asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while 
I lay in the monkey's paw, how I liked the victuals he gave me, his 
manner of feeding, and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened 
my stomach. He desired to know what I would have 
<pb n="144"/> 
done upon such an 
occasion in my own country. I told his Majesty that in Europe we had no 
monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosities from other 
places, and so small that I could deal with a dozen of them 
together, if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous 
animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an 
elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make 
use of my hanger (looking fiercely and clapping my hand upon the 
hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I 
should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to 
withdraw it with more haste than he put it in. This I delivered in a 
firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be 
called in question. However, my speech produced nothing else besides a 
loud laughter, which all the respect due to his Majesty from those 
about him could not make them contain. This made me reflect how vain 
an attempt it is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among those 
who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And 
yet I have seen the moral of my own behavior very frequent in 
England since my return, where a little contemptible varlet, without 
the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall 
presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with 
the greatest persons of the kingdom. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story; and 
Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to 
inform 
<pb n="145"/> 
the Queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought 
would be diverting to her Majesty. The girl, who had been out of 
order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour's 
distance, or thirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach 
near a small footpath in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my 
traveling box, I went out of it to walk. There was a cow dung in the 
path, and I must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over 
it. I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself 
just in the middle up to my knees. I waded through with some 
difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could 
with his handkerchief; for I was filthily bemired, and my nurse 
confined me to my box till we returned home; where the Queen was 
soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about 
the court, so that all the mirth, for some days, was at my expense.

often seen him under the barber's hand, which indeed was at first very 
terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an 
ordinary scythe. His Majesty, according to the custom of the 
country, was only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the 
barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked 
forty or 
<pb n="146"/> 
fifty of the strongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of 
fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in 
it at equal distance with as small a needle as I could get from 
Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and 
sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very 
tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much 
broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know 
any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to 
make me another. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>And this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of 
my leisure hours. I desired the Queen's woman to save for me the 
combings of her Majesty's hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity, 
and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received 
general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two 
chair frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and then to bore 
little holes with a fine <ref target="c0102" corresp="n0102">awl</ref><note xml:id="n0102" target="c0102">A pointed tool for making holes. Source: Oxford English Dictionary</note> round those parts where I designed the 
backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I 
could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England. 
When they were finished, I made a present of them to her Majesty, 
who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities, 
as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them. The 
Queen would have had me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely 
refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die a thousand deaths 
than place a dishonorable part of my body on those precious hairs that 
once adorned her Majesty's 
<pb n="147"/> 
head. Of these hairs (as I had always a 
mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse about five feet 
long, with her Majesty's name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave 
to Glumdalclitch, by the Queen's consent. To say the truth, it was 
more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of 
the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little 
toys that girls are fond of. 
</p> <lb/> <lb/> <p>The King, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to 
which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear 
them; but the noise was so great, that I could hardly distinguish 
the tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal 
army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal 
it. My practice was to have my box removed from the places where the
