<p>"Man is his own star, and the soul that can 
 Render an honest and a perfect man, 
 Command all light, all influence, all fate, 
 Nothing to him falls early or too late. 
 Our acts our angels are, or good or ill, 
 Our fatal shadows that walk by us still."</p>

<p>I READ the other day some verses written by an emi 
 nent painter which were original and not conven 
 tional. Always the soul hears an admonition in such 
 lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment 
 they instil is of more value than any thought they 
 may contain. To believe your own thought, to be 
 lieve that what is true for you in your private heart, is 
 true for all men,-- that is genius. Speak your latent 
 conviction and it shall be the universal sense; for al 
 ways the inmost becomes the outmost, and our 
 first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of 
 the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the 
 mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, 
 Plato, and Milton, is that they set at naught books 
 and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they 
 thought. A man should learn to detect and watch 
 that gleam of light which flashes across his mind 
 from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of

 bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his 
 thought, because it is his. In every work of genius 
 we recognise our own rejected thoughts: they come 
 back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great 
 works of art have no more affecting lesson for us 
 than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous 
 impression with good humored inflexibility then most 
 when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. 
 Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly 
 good sense precisely what we have thought and felt 
 all the time, and we shall be forced to take with 
 shame our own opinion from another.</p> 
 
<p>There is a time in every man's education when he 
 arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that 
 imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for 
 better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide 
 universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn 
 can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that 
 plot of ground which is given to him to till. The 
 power which resides in him is new in nature, and none 
 but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does 
 he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, 
 one character, one fact makes much impression on 
 him, and another none. It is not without preestab 
 lished harmony, this sculpture in the memory. The 
 eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it 
 might testify of that particular ray. Bravely let him 
 speak the utmost syllable of his confession. We but 
 half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that di 
 vine idea which each of us represents. It may be 
 safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so

 it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his 
 work made manifest by cowards. It needs a divine 
 man to exhibit any thing divine. A man is relieved 
 and gay when he has put his heart into his work and 
 done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, 
 shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which 
 does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts 
 him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.</p> 
 
<p>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron 
 string. Accept the place the divine Providence has 
 found for you; the society of your contemporaries, 
 the connexion of events. Great men have always 
 done so and confided themselves childlike to the genius 
 of their age, betraying their perception that the 
 Eternal was stirring at their heart, working through 
 their hands, predominating in all their being. And 
 we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind 
 the same transcendent destiny; and not pinched in a 
 corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but 
 redeemers and benefactors, pious aspirants to be 
 noble clay plastic under the Almighty effort, let us 
 advance and advance on Chaos and the Dark.</p> 
 
<p>What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in 
 the face and behavior of children, babes and even 
 brutes. That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of 
 a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the 
 strength and means opposed to our purpose, these 
 have not. Their mind being whole, their eye is as 
 yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces, we 
 are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody: all 
 conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four

 or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it. 
 So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood 
 no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it 
 enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, 
 if it will stand by itself. Do not think the youth has 
 no force because he cannot speak to you and me.
 Hark! in the next room, who spoke so clear and em 
 phatic? Good Heaven! it is he! it is that very lump of 
 bashfulness and phlegm which for weeks has done 
 nothing but eat when you were by, that now rolls out 
 these words like bell-strokes. It seems he knows how 
 to speak to his contemporaries. Bashful or bold, then, 
 he will know how to make us seniors very unneces 
 sary. </p>
 
<p>The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a din 
 ner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say 
 aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of hu 
 man nature. How is a boy the master of society; in 
 dependent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner 
 on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sen 
 tences them on their merits, in the swift summary 
 way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, 
 troublesome. He cumbers himself never about con 
 sequences, about interests: he gives an independent, 
 genuine verdict. You must court him: he does not 
 court you. But the man is, as it were, clapped into 
 jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has once 
 acted or spoken with eclat, he is a committed person, 
 watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds 
 whose affections must now enter into his account. 
 There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could pass

 again into his neutral, godlike independence! Who can 
 thus lose all pledge, and having observed, observe 
 again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, 
 unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable, 
 must always engage the poet's and the man's regards. 
 Of such an immortal youth the force would be felt. 
 He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which 
 being seen to be not private but necessary, would sink 
 like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.</p> 
 
<p>These are the voices which we hear in solitude, 
 but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into 
 the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy 
 against the manhood of every one of its members. 
 Society is a joint-stock company in which the mem 
 bers agree for the better securing of his bread to each 
 shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of 
 the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. 
 Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and 
 creators, but names and customs.</p> 
 
<p>Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. 
 He who would gather immortal palms must not be hin 
 dered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it 
 be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity 
 of our own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you 
 shall have the suffrage of the world. I remember an an 
 swer which when quite young I was prompted to make 
 to a valued adviser who was wont to importune me with 
 the dear old doctrines of the church. On my saying, 
 What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, 
 if I live wholly from within ? my friend suggested 
 "But these impulses may be from below, not from 
 


 <pb n="42" facs="pageImages/0042.jpg"/>

 
 
 above." I replied, "They do not seem to me to be 
 such; but if I am the devil's child, 1 will live then 
 from the devil." No law can be sacred to me but that 
 of my nature. Good and bad are but names very 
 readily transferable to that or this; the only right is 
 what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is 
 against it. A man is to carry himself in the presence 
 of all opposition as if every thing were titular and 
 ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily 
 we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies 
 and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken 
 individual affects and sways me more than is right. 
 I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude 
 truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat 
 of philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot 
 assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes 
 to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should 
 I not say to him, 'Go love thy infant; love thy wood- 
 chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that 
 grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable 
 ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk 
 a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.' 
 Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth 
 is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your 
 goodness must have some edge to it else it is none. 
 The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the coun 
 teraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and 
 whines. I shun father and mother and wife and bro 
 ther, when my genius calls me. I would write on the 
 lintels of the door-post, Whim. I hope it is somewhat 
 better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day

 in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I 
 seek or why I exclude company. Then, again, do not 
 tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to 
 put all poor men in good situations. Are they my 
 poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I 
 grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent I give to such 
 men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not be 
 long. There is a class of persons to whom by all 
 spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I 
 will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous 
 popular charities; the education at college of fools; 
 the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which 
 many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousandfold 
 Relief Societies; though I confess with shame I 
 sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked 
 dollar which by-and-by I shall have the manhood to 
 withhold.</p> 
 
<p>Virtues are in the popular estimate rather the ex 
 ception than the rule. There is the man and his vir 
 tues. Men do what is called a good action, as some 
 piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay 
 a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on pa 
 rade. Their works are done as an apology or exten 
 uation of their living in the world, as invalids and 
 the insane pay a high board. Their virtues are pen 
 ances. I do not wish to expiate, but to live. My life 
 is not an apology, but a life. It is for itself and not 
 for a spectacle. I much prefer that it should be of a 
 lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it 
 should be glittering and unsteady- I wish it to be 
 sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding.</p>
 

<pb n="44" facs="pageImages/0044.jpg"/>
 
 
<p>My life should be unique; it should be an alms, a 
 battle, a conquest, a medicine. I ask primary evi 
 dence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from 
 the man to his actions. I know that for myself it 
 makes no difference whether I do or forbear those 
 actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot 
 consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic 
 right. Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actu 
 ally am, and do not need for my own assurance or 
 the assurance of my fellows any secondary testi 
 mony.</p>
 
<p>What I must do, is all that concerns me, not what 
 the people think. This rule, equally arduous in ac 
 tual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole dis 
 tinction between greatness and meanness. It is the 
 harder, because you will always find those who think 
 they know what is your duty better than you know it. 
 It is easy in the world to live after the world's opin 
 ion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but 
 the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd 
 keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of sol 
 itude.</p>
 
<p>The objection to conforming to usages that have be 
 come dead to you, is, that it scatters your force. It 
 loses your time and blurs the impression of your char 
 acter. If you maintain a dead church, contribute 
 to a dead Bible-Society, vote with a great party 
 either for the Government or against it, spread your 
 table like base housekeepers,-- under all these 
 screens, I have difficulty to detect the precise man 
 you are. And, of course, so much force is with 
 

 <pb n="45" facs="pageImages/0045.jpg"/>


 
 drawn from your proper life. But do your thing, and 
 I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall re 
 inforce yourself. A man must consider what a blind 
 man's-buff is this game of conformity. If I know 
 your sect, I anticipate your argument. I hear a 
 preacher announce for his text and topic the expedi 
 ency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I 
 not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a 
 new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that 
 with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of 
 the institution, he will do no such thing? Do I not 
 know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at 
 one side; the permitted side, not as a man, but as a 
 parish minister? He is a retained attorney, and these 
 airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Well, 
 most men have bound their eyes with one or another 
 handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one 
 of these communities of opinion. This conformity 
 makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of 
 a few lies, but false in all particulars. Their every 
 truth is not quite true. Their two is not the real two, 
 their four not the real four: so that every word they 
 say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to 
 set them right. Meantime nature is not slow to equip 
 us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we 
 adhere. We come to wear one cut of face and fig 
 ure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine ex 
 pression. There is a mortifying experience in par 
 ticular which does not fail to wreak itself also in the 
 general history; I mean, "the foolish face of praise," 
 the forced smile which we put on in company where 
 


 <pb n="46" facs="pageImages/0046.jpg"/>

 
 we do not feel atease in answer to conversation which 
 does not interest us. The muscles, not spontaneously 
 moved, but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow 
 tight about the outline of the face and make the most 
 disagreeable sensation, a sensation of rebuke and 
 warning which no brave young man will suffer twice. </p>
 
<p>For non-conformity the world whips you with its 
 displeasure. And therefore a man must know how 
 to estimate a sour face. The bystanders look askance 
 on him in the public street or in the friend's parlor. 
 If this aversation had its origin in contempt and re 
 sistance like his own, he might well go home with a 
 sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, 
 like their sweet faces, have no deep cause,-- disguise 
 no god, but are put on and off as the wind blows, 
 and a newspaper directs. Yet is the discontent of the 
 multitude more formidable than that of the senate 
 and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man 
 who knows the world to brook the rage of the culti 
 vated classes. Their rage is decorous and prudent, 
 for they are timid as being very vulnerable themselves. 
 But when to their feminine rage the indignation of 
 the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor 
 are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that 
 lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and 
 mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion 
 to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.</p> 
 
<p> The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our 
 consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, 
 because the eyes of others have no other data for 
 computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are 
 loath to disappoint them. </p>
 

<pb n="47" facs="pageImages/0047.jpg"/>


 
<p>But why should you keep your head over your 
 shoulder? Why drag about this monstrous corpse of 
 your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have 
 stated in this or that public place? Suppose you 
 should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to 
 be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory 
 alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, 
 but bring the past for judgment into the thousand- 
 eyed present, and live ever in a new day. Trust 
 your emotion. In your metaphysics you have de 
 nied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout 
 motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and 
 life, though they should clothe God with shape and 
 color. Leave your theory as Joseph his coat in the 
 hand of the harlot, and flee.</p> 
 
<p>A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little 
 minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers 
 and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply 
 nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with 
 his shadow on the wall. Out upon your guarded lips! 
 Sew them up with packthread, do. Else, if you 
 would be a man, speak what you think to-day in words 
 as hard as cannon balls, and to-morrow speak what 
 to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it con 
 tradict every thing you said to-day. Ah, then, ex 
 claim the aged ladies, you shall be sure to be misu
 derstood. Misunderstood! It is a right fool's word. 
 Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras 
 was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Lu 
 ther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and 
 every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To 
 be great is to be misunderstood. </p>

<p>I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the 
 sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his be 
 ing as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are 
 insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it 
 matter how you guage and try him. A character is 
 like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza; read it for 
 ward, backward, or across, it still spells the same 
 thing. In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God 
 allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought 
 without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it 
 will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not, and 
 see it not. My book should smell of pines and resound 
 with the hum of insects. The swallow over my win 
 dow should interweave that thread or straw he carries 
 in his bill into my web also. We pass for what we are. 
 Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that 
 they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt 
 actions and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath 
 every moment.</p> 
 
<p>Fear never but you shall be consistent in whatever 
 variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural 
 in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be har 
 monious, however unlike they seem. These varieties 
 are lost sight of when seen at a little distance, at a lit 
 tle height of thought. One tendency unites them all. 
 The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hun 
 dred tacks. This is only microscopic criticism. See 
 the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens 
 itself to the average tendency. Your genuine action 
 will explain itself and will explain your other genuine 
 actions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act sin

 gly, and what you have already done singly, will justify 
 you now. Greatness always appeals to the future. 
 If I can be great enough now to do right and scorn 
 eyes, I must have done so much right before, as to de 
 fend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Al 
 ways scorn appearances, and you always may. The 
 force of character is cumulative. All the foregone 
 days of virtue work their health into this. What 
 makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the 
 field, which so fills the imagination? The conscious 
 ness of a train of great days and victories behind. 
 There they all stand and shed an united light on the 
 advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible es 
 cort of angels to every man's eye. That is it which 
 throws thunder into Chatham's voice, and dignity into 
 Washington's port, and America into Adams's eye. 
 Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemeris. 
 It is always ancient virtue. We worship it to-day, be 
 cause it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it hom 
 age, because it is not a trap for our love and homage, 
 but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an 
 old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young 
 person.</p> 
 
<p>I hope in these days we have heard the last of con 
 formity and consistency. Let the words be gazetted 
 and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for 
 dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. 
 Let us bow and apologize never more. A great man 
 is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please 
 him: I wish that he should wish to please me. I will 
 stand here for humanity, and though I would make it

 kind, I would made it true. Let us affront and repri 
 mand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment 
 of the times, and hurl in the face of custom, and trade, 
 and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, 
 that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor 
 moving wherever moves a man; that a true man be 
 longs to no other time or place, but is the centre of 
 things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures 
 you, and all men, and all events. You are constrained 
 to accept his standard. Ordinarily every body in soci 
 ety reminds us of somewhat else or of some other 
 person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing 
 else. It takes place of the whole creation. The man 
 must be so much that he must make all circumstances 
 indifferent, put all means into the shade. This all 
 great men are and do. Every true man is a cause, a 
 country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and num 
 bers and time fully to accomplish his thought; and 
 posterity seem to follow his steps as a procession. A 
 man Caesar is born, and for ages after, we have a Ro 
 man Empire. Christ is born, and millions of minds 
 so grow and cleave to his genius, that he is confound 
 ed with virtue and the possible of man. An institution 
 is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, the Refor 
 mation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, 
 of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton 
 called "the height of Rome;" and all history resolves 
 itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and 
 earnest persons.</p> 
 
<p>Let a man then know his worth, and keep things un 
 der his feet. Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up

 and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or 
 an interloper, in the world which exists for him. But 
 the man in the street finding no worth in himself which 
 corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculp 
 tured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. 
 To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an 
 alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, 
 and seem to say like that, 'Who are you, sir?' Yet 
 they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his 
 faculties that they will come out and take possession. 
 The picture waits for my verdict: it is not to command 
 me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That pop 
 ular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in 
 the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and 
 dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, 
 treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, 
 and assured that he had been insane, owes its popu 
 larity to the fact, that it symbolizes so well the state of 
 man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then 
 wakes up, exercises his reason, and finds himself a true 
 prince. </p>
 
<p>Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In his 
 tory, our imagination makes fools of us, plays us false. 
 Kingdom and lordship, power and estate are a gaudier 
 vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small 
 house and common day's work: but the things of life 
 are the same to both: the sum total of both is the 
 same. Why all this deference to Alfred, and Scander 
 beg, and Gustavus? Suppose they were virtuous: 
 did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends 
 on your private act to-day, as followed their public and 
 


<pb n="52" facs="pageImages/0052.jpg"/>


 
 renowned steps. When private men shall act with 
 vast views, the lustre will be transferred from the ac 
 tions of kings to those of gentlemen. </p>
 
<p>The world has indeed been instructed by its kings, 
 who have so magnetized the eyes of nations. It has 
 been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual rever 
 ence that is due from man to man. The joyful loy 
 alty with which men have every where suffered the 
 king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among 
 them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men 
 and things, and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with 
 money but with honor, and represent the Law in his 
 person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely 
 signified their consciousness of their own right and 
 comeliness, the right of every man.</p> 
 
<p>The magnetism which all original action exerts is 
 explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. 
 Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self on 
 which a universal reliance may be grounded? What 
 is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, 
 without parallax, without calculable elements, which 
 shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure 
 actions, if the least mark of independence appear? 
 The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence 
 of genius, the essence of virtue, and the essence of life, 
 which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote 
 this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teach 
 ings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact be 
 hind which analysis cannot go, all things find their 
 common origin. For the sense of being which in 
 calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not 
 



<pb n="53" facs="pageImages/0053.jpg"/>


 
 diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, 
 from man, but one with them, and proceedeth obvious 
 ly from the same source whence their life and be 
 ing also proceedeth. We first share the life by 
 which things exist, and afterwards see them as 
 appearances in nature, and forget that we have 
 shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action 
 and the fountain of thought. Here are the lungs of 
 that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, of that in 
 spiration of man which cannot be denied without im 
 piety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense in 
 telligence, which makes us organs of its activity and 
 receivers of its truth. When we discern justice, when 
 we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow 
 a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, 
 if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all meta 
 physics, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its 
 absence is all we can affirm. Every man discerns 
 between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his invol 
 untary perceptions. And to his involuntary percep 
 tions, he knows a perfect respect is due. He may err 
 in the expression of them, but he knows that these 
 things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. 
 All my wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving; 
 the most trivial reverie, the faintest native emotion 
 are domestic and divine, Thoughtless people contra 
 dict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opin 
 ions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not 
 distinguish between perception and notion. They fan 
 cy that I choose to see this or that thing. But percep 
 tion is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my 
 children will see it after me, and in course of time, all 
 



<pb n="54" facs="pageImages/0054.jpg"/>


 
 mankind, although it may chance that no one has 
 seen it before me. For my perception of it is as 
 much a fact as the sun.</p> 
 
<p>The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so 
 pure that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It 
 must be that when God speaketh, he should communi 
 cate not one thing, but all things; should fill the world 
 with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, 
 souls, from the centre of the present thought; and 
 new date and new create the whole. Whenever 
 a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, 
 then old things pass away, means, teachers, texts, 
 temples fall; it lives now and absorbs past and 
 future into the present hour. All things are made sa 
 cred by relation to it, one thing as much as another. 
 All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, 
 and in the universal miracle petty and particular mir 
 acles disappear. This is and must be. If, therefore, 
 a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries 
 you backward to the phraseology of some old moul 
 dered nation in another country, in another world, 
 believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak 
 which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent 
 better than the child into whom he has cast his ri 
 pened being? Whence then this worship of the past? 
 The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and 
 majesty of the soul. Time and space are but phy 
 siological colors which the eye maketh, but the soul is 
 light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and 
 history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be 
 anything more than a cheerful apologue or parable 
 of my being and becoming.</p> 
 



<pb n="55" facs="pageImages/0055.jpg"/>
 
<p>Man is timid and apologetic. He is no longer up- 
 right. He dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes 
 some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade 
 of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my 
 window make no reference to former roses or to bet 
 ter ones; they are for what they are; they exist with 
 God to-day. There is no time to them. There is 
 simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its 
 existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life 
 acts; in the full-blown flower, there is no more; in 
 the leafless root, there is no less. Its nature is satis 
 fied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. There 
 is no time to it. But man postpones or remembers; 
 he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye 
 laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that sur 
 round him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He 
 cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with 
 nature in the present, above time.</p> 
 
<p>This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong 
 intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak 
 the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremi 
 ah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price 
 on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children 
 who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and 
 tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents 
 and character they chance to see, painfully recol 
 lecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when 
 they come into the point of view which those had who 
 uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are 
 willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can 
 use words as good, when occasion comes. So was it 
 

<pb n="56" facs="pageImages/0056.jpg"/>


 
 with us, so will it be, if we proceed. If we live truly, 
 we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man 
 to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When 
 we have new perception, we shall gladly disburthen 
 the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. 
 When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet 
 as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.</p> 
 
<p>And now at last the highest truth on this subject re 
 mains unsaid; probably, cannot be said; for all that 
 we say is the far off remembering of the intuition. 
 That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to 
 say it, is this. When good is near you, when you 
 have life in yourself,-- it is not by any known or ap 
 pointed way; you shall not discern the foot-prints of 
 any other; you shall not see the face of man; you 
 shall not hear any name;-- the way, the thought, the 
 good shall be wholly strange and new. It shall ex 
 clude all other being. You take the way from man 
 not to man. All persons that ever existed are its fu 
 gitive ministers. There shall be no fear in it. Fear 
 and hope are alike beneath it. It asks nothing. 
 There is somewhat low even in hope. We are then 
 in vision. There is nothing that can be called grat 
 itude nor properly joy. The soul is raised over pas 
 sion. It seeth identity and eternal causation. It is a 
 perceiving that Truth and Right are. Hence it be 
 comes a Tranquillity out of the knowing that all things 
 go well. Vast spaces of nature; the Atlantic Ocean, 
 the South Sea; vast intervals of time, years, centuries, 
 are of no account. This which I think and feel, un 
 derlay that former state of life and circumstances, as 
 



<pb n="57" facs="pageImages/0057.jpg"/>


 
 it does underlie my present, and will always all cir 
 cumstance, and what is called life, and what is called 
 death.</p> 
 
<p>Life only avails, not the having lived. Power 
 ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the mo 
 ment of transition from a past to a new state; in the 
 shooting of the gulf; in the darting to an aim. This 
 one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes; for, 
 that forever degrades the past; turns all riches to pov 
 erty; all reputation to a shame; confounds the saint 
 with the rogue; shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. 
 Why then do we prate of self-reliance? Inasmuch 
 as the soul is present, there will be power not confi 
 dent but agent. To talk of reliance, is a poor exter 
 nal way of speaking. Speak rather of that which re 
 lies, because it works and is. Who has more soul 
 than I, masters me, though he should not raise his fin 
 ger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of 
 spirits; who has less, I rule with like facility. We 
 fancy it rhetoric when we speak of eminent virtue. 
 We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a 
 man or a company of men plastic and permeable to 
 principles, by the law of nature must overpower and 
 ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are 
 not.</p> 
 
<p> This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach 
 on this as on every topic, the resolution of all into the 
 ever blessed ONE. Virtue is the governor, the crea 
 tor, the reality. All things real are so by so much of 
 virtue as they contain. Hardship, husbandry, hunting, 
 whaling, war, eloquence, personal weight, are some 
 
 



<pb n="58" facs="pageImages/0058.jpg"/>


 
 what, and engage my respect as examples of the 
 soul's presence and impure action. I see the same 
 law working in nature for conservation and growth. 
 The poise of a planet, the bended tree recovering it 
 self from the strong wind, the vital resources of every 
 vegetable and animal, are also demonstrations of the 
 self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul. All his 
 tory from its highest to its trivial passages is the vari 
 ous record of this power.</p> 
 
<p>Thus all concentrates; let us not rove; let us sit at 
 home with the cause. Let us stun and astonish the in 
 truding rabble of men and books and institutions by a 
 simple declaration of the divine fact. Bid them take the 
 shoes from off their feet, for God is here within. Let our 
 simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law 
 demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside 
 our native riches.</p> 
 
<p>But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe 
 of man, nor is the soul admonished to stay at home, 
 to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, 
 but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns 
 of men. We must go alone. Isolation must pre 
 cede true society. I like the silent church before the 
 service begins, better than any preaching. How far 
 off, how cool, how chaste the persons look, begirt 
 each one with a precinct or sanctuary. So let us 
 always sit. Why should we assume the faults of our 
 friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit 
 around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood? 
 All men have my blood, and I have all men's. Not 
 for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to 
 


<pb n="59" facs="pageImages/0059.jpg"/>


 
 the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isola 
 tion must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must 
 be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be 
 in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. 
 Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all 
 knock at once at thy closet door and say, ' \Come out 
 unto us.'-- Do not spill thy soul; do not all descend; 
 keep thy state; stay at home in thine own heaven; 
 come not for a moment into their facts, into their hub 
 bub of conflicting appearances, but let in the light of 
 thy law on their confusion. The power men possess 
 to annoy me, I give them by a weak curiosity. No man 
 can come near me but through my act. "What we 
 love that we have, but by desire we bereave our 
 selves of the love."</p> 
 
<p>If we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedi 
 ence and faith, let us at least resist our temptations, 
 let us enter into the state of war, and wake Thor and 
 Woden, courage and constancy in our Saxon breasts. 
 This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking 
 the truth. Check this lying hospitality and lying af 
 fection. Live no longer to the expectation of these 
 deceived and deceiving people with whom we con 
 verse. Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, 
 O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after ap 
 pearances hitherto. Henceforward I am the truth's. 
 Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no 
 law less than the eternal law. I will have no cove 
 nants but proximities. I shall endeavor to nourish my 
 parents, to support my family, to be the chaste hus 
 band of one wife, but these relations I must fill after 
 
 <pb n="60" facs="pageImages/0060.jpg"/>
 
 a new and unprecedented way. I appeal from your 
 customs. I must be myself. I cannot break myself 
 any longer for you, or you. If you can love me for 
 what I am, we shall be the happier. If you cannot, I 
 will still seek to deserve that you should. I must be 
 myself. I will not hide my tastes or aversions. I 
 will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do 
 strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly re 
 joices me, and the heart appoints. If you are noble, 
 I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you 
 and myself by hypocritical attentions. If you are 
 true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your 
 companions; I will seek my own. I do this not self 
 ishly, but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest 
 and mine and all men's, however long we have dwelt 
 in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh to-day? 
 You will soon love what is dictated by your nature 
 as well as mine, and if we follow the truth, it will 
 bring us out safe at last.-- But so you may give 
 these friends pain. Yes, but I cannot sell my liber 
 ty and my power, to save their sensibility. Besides, 
 all persons have their moments of reason when they 
 look out into the region of absolute truth; then will 
 they justify me and do the same thing.</p> 
 
<p>The populace think that your rejection of popular 
 standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere an 
 tinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the 
 name of philosophy to gild his crimes. But the law 
 of consciousness abides. There are two confession 
 als, in one or the other of which we must be shriven. 
 You may fulfil your round of duties by clearing 
 



<pb n="61" facs="pageImages/0061.jpg"/>

 
 yourself in the direct, or, in the reflex way. Con 
 sider whether you have satisfied your relations to 
 father, mother, cousin, neighbor, town, cat, and 
 dog; whether any of these can upbraid you. But 
 I may also neglect this reflex standard, and ab 
 solve me to myself. I have my own stern claims 
 and perfect circle. It denies the name of duty to 
 many offices that are called duties. But if I can 
 discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the 
 popular code. If any one imagines that this law is 
 lax, let him keep its commandment one day.</p> 
 
<p>And truly it demands something godlike in him 
 who has cast off the common motives of humanity, 
 and has ventured to trust himself for a task-master. 
 High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, 
 that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law 
 to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as 
 strong as iron necessity is to others.</p> 
 
<p>If any man consider the present aspects of what is 
 called by distinction society, he will see the need of 
 these ethics. The sinew and heart of man seem to 
 be drawn out, and we are become timorous despond 
 ing whimperers. We are afraid of truth, afraid of 
 fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other. 
 Our age yields no great and perfect persons. We 
 want men and women who shall renovate life and 
 our social state, but we see that most natures are in 
 solvent; cannot satisfy their own wants, have an am 
 bition out of all proportion to their practical force, 
 and so do lean and beg day and night continually. 
 Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupa 
 


<pb n="62" facs="pageImages/0062.jpg"/>


 
 tions, our marriages, our religion we have not chosen, 
 but society has chosen for us. We are parlor sol 
 diers. The rugged battle of fate, where strength is 
 born, we shun.</p> 
 
<p>If our young men miscarry in their first enterprizes, 
 they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, 
 men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at 
 one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office 
 within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of 
 Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to 
 himself that he is right in being disheartened and in 
 complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from 
 New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the 
 professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a 
 school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, 
 buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, 
 and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth 
 a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast 
 with his days, and feels no shame in not ' study 
 ing a profession,' for he does not postpone his life, 
 but lives already. He has not one chance, but a 
 hundred chances. Let a stoic arise who shall reveal 
 the resources of man, and tell men they are not lean 
 ing willows, but can and must detach themselves; that 
 with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall ap 
 pear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed 
 healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of 
 our compassion, and that the moment he acts from 
 himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and 
 customs out of the window,-- we pity him no more

 but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall re 
 store the life of man to splendor, and make his name 
 dear to all History.</p> 
 
<p>It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance,-- a 
 new respect for the divinity in man,-- must work a 
 revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in 
 their religion; in their education; in their pursuits; 
 their modes of living; their association; in their prop 
 erty; in their speculative views.</p> 
 
<p>1. In what prayers do men allow themselves! That 
 which they call a holy office, is not so much as brave 
 and manly. Prayer looks abroad and asks for some 
 foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, 
 and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and su 
 pernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous. Prayer 
 that craves a particular commodity-- any thing less 
 than all good, is vicious. Prayer is the contem 
 plation of the facts of life from the highest point 
 of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and 
 jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing 
 his works good. But prayer as a means to ef 
 fect a private end, is theft and meanness. It sup 
 poses dualism and not unity in nature and con 
 sciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, 
 he will not beg. He will then see prayer in all ac 
 tion. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field 
 to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the 
 stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard through 
 out nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in 
 Fletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the 
 mind of the god Audate, replies,</p> 
 

<pb n="64" facs="pageImages/0064.jpg"/>


 
<p>"His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors, 
 Our valors are our best gods."</p> 
 
<p>Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. 
 Discontent is the want of self-reliance: it is infirm 
 ity of will. Regret calamities, if you can thereby 
 help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and 
 already the evil begins to be repaired. Our sympa 
 thy is just as base. We come to them who weep 
 foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead 
 of imparting to them truth and health in rough elec 
 tric shocks, putting them once more in communica 
 tion with the soul. The secret of fortune is joy in 
 our hands. Welcome evermore to gods and men is 
 the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung 
 wide. Him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all 
 eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out to him 
 and embraces him, because he did not need it. We 
 solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate 
 him, because he held on his way and scorned our dis 
 approbation. The gods love him because men hated 
 him. "To the persevering mortal," said Zoroaster, 
 "the blessed Immortals are swift."</p> 
 
<p>As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are 
 their creeds a disease of the intellect. They say 
 with those foolish Israelites, 'Let not God speak to us, 
 lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, 
 and we will obey.' Everywhere I am bereaved of 
 meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his 
 own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his 
 brother's, or his brother's brother's God. Every new 
 mind is a new classification. If it prove a mind of 
 


<pb n="65" facs="pageImages/0065.jpg"/>


 
 uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a 
 Hutton, a Bentham, a Spurzheim, it imposes its clas 
 sification on other men, and lo! a new system. In 
 proportion always to the depth of the thought, and so 
 to the number of the objects it touches and brings 
 within reach of the pupil, is his complacency. But 
 chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which 
 are also classifications of some powerful mind acting 
 on the great elemental thought of Duty, and man's 
 relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism, Quaker 
 ism, Swedenborgianism. The pupil takes the same 
 delight in subordinating every thing to the new termi 
 nology that a girl does who has just learned botany, 
 in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It 
 will happen for a time, that the pupil will feel a real 
 debt to the teacher,-- will find his intellectual power 
 has grown by the study of his writings. This will 
 continue until he has exhausted his master's mind. 
 But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is 
 idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily 
 exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system 
 blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the 
 walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem 
 to them hung on the arch their master built. They 
 cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see,-- 
 how you can see; 'It must be somehow that you 
 stole the light from us.' They do not yet perceive, 
 that, light unsystematic, indomitable, will break into 
 any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile 
 and call it their own. If they are honest and do 
 well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too

 strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and van 
 ish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, 
 million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the 
 universe as on the first morning.</p> 
 
<p>2. It is for want of self-culture that the idol of Tra 
 velling, the idol of Italy, of England, of Egypt, re 
 mains for all educated Americans. They who made 
 England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagina 
 tion, did so not by rambling round creation as a moth 
 round a lamp, but by sticking fast where they were, 
 like an axis of the earth. In manly hours, we feel 
 that duty is our place, and that the merry men of cir 
 cumstance should follow as they may. The soul is 
 no traveller: the wise man stays at home with the 
 soul, and when his necessities, his duties, on any oc 
 casion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, 
 he is at home still, and is not gadding abroad from 
 himself, and shall make men sensible by the expres 
 sion of his countenance, that he goes the missionary 
 of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a 
 sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet. </p>
 
<p>I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation 
 of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and 
 benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or 
 does not go abroad with the hope of finding some 
 what greater than he knows. He who travels to be 
 amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, 
 travels away from himself, and grows old even in 
 youth among old things. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his 
 will and mind have become old and dilapidated as 
 they. He carries ruins to ruins.</p> 
 


<pb n="67" facs="pageImages/0067.jpg"/>

 
<p>Travelling is a fool's paradise. We owe to our 
 first journeys the discovery that place is nothing. At 
 home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be in 
 toxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack 
 my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, 
 and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is 
 the stern Fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that 
 I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I 
 affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but 
 I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever 
 I go.</p> 
 
<p>3. But the rage of travelling is itself only a symp 
 tom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intel 
 lectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and the 
 universal system of education fosters restlessness 
 Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay 
 at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but 
 the travelling of the mind? Our houses are built 
 with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with 
 foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our 
 whole minds lean, and follow the Past and the Distant, 
 as the eyes of a maid follow her mistress. The soul 
 created the arts wherever they have flourished. It 
 was in his own mind that the artist sought his model. 
 It was an application of his own thought to the thing 
 to be done and the conditions to be observed. And 
 why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? 
 Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint 
 expression are as near to us as to any, and if the 
 American artist will study with hope and love the 
 precise thing to be done by him, considering the cli

 mate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the 
 people, the habit and form of the government, he will 
 create a house in which all these will find them 
 selves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied 
 also.</p> 
 
<p>Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift 
 you can present every moment with the cumulative 
 force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted 
 talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, 
 half possession. That which each can do best, none 
 but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows 
 what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. 
 Where is the master who could have taught Shak 
 speare? Where is the master who could have in 
 structed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or New 
 ton. Every great man is an unique. The Scipionism 
 of Scipio is precisely that part he could not bor 
 row. If any body will tell me whom the great man 
 imitates in the original crisis when he performs a 
 great act, I will tell him who else than himself can 
 teach him. Shakspeare will never be made by the 
 study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned thee, 
 and thou canst not hope too much or dare too much. 
 There is at this moment, there is for me an utterance 
 bare and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phi 
 dias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, 
 or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly 
 will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven 
 tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if I can hear what 
 these patriarchs say, surely I can reply to them in the 
 same pitch of voice: for the ear and the tongue are 
 



<pb n="69" facs="pageImages/0069.jpg"/>


 
 two organs of one nature. Dwell up there in the sim 
 ple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart, and 
 thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.</p> 
 
<p> 4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look 
 abroad, so does our spirit of society. All men 
 plume themselves on the improvement of society, and 
 no man improves.</p> 
 
<p>Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one 
 side as it gains on the other. Its progress is only ap 
 parent, like the workers of a treadmill. It undergoes 
 continual changes: it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is 
 christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change 
 is not amelioration. For every thing that is given, 
 something is taken. Society acquires new arts and 
 loses old instincts. What a contrast between the well 
 clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a 
 watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, 
 and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a 
 club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a 
 shed to sleep under. But compare the health of the two 
 men, and you shall see that his aboriginal strength the 
 white man has lost. If the traveller tell us truly, 
 strike the savage with a broad axe, and in a day or 
 two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck 
 the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send 
 the white to his grave.</p> 
 
<p>The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the 
 use of his feet. He is supported on crutches, but 
 loses so much support of muscle. He has got a fine 
 Geneva watch, but he has lost the skill to tell the hour 
 by the sun. A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, 
 


<pb n="70" facs="pageImages/0070.jpg"/>

 
 
 and so being sure of the information when he wants 
 it, the man in the street does not know a star in the 
 sky. The solstice he does not observe; the equi 
 nox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar 
 of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note 
 books impair his memory; his libraries overload his 
 wit; the insurance office increases the number of 
 accidents; and it may be a question whether machi 
 nery does not encumber; whether we have not lost 
 by refinement some energy, by a Christianity en 
 trenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of 
 wild virtue. For every stoic was a stoic; but in 
 Christendom where is the Christian?</p> 
 
<p>There is no more deviation in the moral standard 
 than in the standard of height or bulk. No greater 
 men are now than ever were. A singular equality 
 may be observed between the great men of the first 
 and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, re 
 ligion and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail 
 to educate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three 
 or four and twenty centuries ago. Not in time is 
 the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates, Anaxago- 
 ras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class. 
 He who is really of their class will not be called by 
 their name, but be wholly his own man, and, in his turn 
 the founder of a sect. The arts and inventions of 
 each period are only its costume, and do not invigo 
 rate men. The harm of the improved machinery 
 may compensate its good. Hudson and Behring 
 accomplished so much in their fishing-boats, as to as 
 tonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhatfst- 
 


<pb n="71" facs="pageImages/0071.jpg"/>


 
 ed the resources of science and art. Galileo, with 
 an opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of 
 facts than any one since. Columbus found the New 
 World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the 
 periodical disuse and perishing of means and ma 
 chinery which were introduced with loud laudation, 
 a few years or centuries before. The great genius 
 returns to essential man. We reckoned the improve 
 ments of the art of war among the triumphs of sci 
 ence, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the 
 Bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked 
 valor, and disencumbering it of all aids. The Em 
 peror held it impossible to make a perfect army, 
 says Las Casas, "without abolishing our arms, mag 
 azines, commissaries, and carriages, until in imitation 
 of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his 
 supply of corn, grind it in his hand-mill, and bake his 
 bread himself." </p>
 
<p>Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but 
 the water of which it is composed, does not. The 
 same particle does not rise from the valley to the 
 ridge. Its unity is only phenomenal. The persons 
 who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and 
 their experience with them.</p> 
 
<p>And so the reliance on Property, including the re 
 liance on governments which protect it, is the want 
 of self-reliance. Men have looked away from them 
 selves and at things so long, that they have come to 
 esteem what they call the soul's progress, namely, 
 the religious, learned, and civil institutions, as guards 
 of property, and they deprecate assaults on these, 
 



<pb n="72" facs="pageImages/0072.jpg"/>

 
 
 because they feel them to be assaults on property 
 They measure their esteem of each other, by what each 
 has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man 
 becomes ashamed of his property, ashamed of what 
 he has, out of new respect for his being. Especially 
 he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental,-- 
 came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime; then 
 he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to 
 him, has no root in him, and merely lies there, be 
 cause no revolution or no robber takes it away. But 
 that which a man is, does always by necessity ac 
 quire, and what the man acquires is permanent and 
 living property, which does not wait the beck of ru 
 lers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or 
 bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever 
 the man is put. "Thy lot or portion of life," said 
 the Caliph Ali, "is seeking after thee; therefore be 
 at rest from seeking after it." Our dependence on 
 these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for 
 numbers. The political parties meet in numerous 
 conventions; the greater the concourse, and with 
 each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex! The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels 
 himself stronger than before by a new thousand of 
 eyes and arms. In like manner the reformers sum 
 mon conventions, and vote and resolve in multitude. 
 But not so, O friends! will the God deign to enter 
 and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the re 
 verse. It is only as a man puts off from himself all 
 external support, and stands alone, that I see him to 
 



<pb n="73" facs="pageImages/0073.jpg"/>

 
 be strong and to prevail. He is weaker by every 
 recruit to his banner. Is not a man better than a 
 town? Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mu 
 tation, thou only firm column must presently appear 
 the upholder of all that surrounds thee. He who 
 knows that power is in the soul, that he is weak on 
 ly because he has looked for good out of him and 
 elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesi 
 tatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands 
 in the erect position, commands his limbs, works 
 miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is 
 stronger than a man who stands on his head. </p>
 
<p> So use all that is called Fortune. Most men gamble 
 with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls. 
 Bu tdo thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and 
 deal with Cause and Effect, the chancellors of God. In 
 the Will work and acquire, and thou hast chained the 
 wheel of Chance, and shalt always drag her after 
 thee. A political victory, a rise of rents, the re 
 covery of your sick, or the return of your absent 
 friend, or some other quite external event, raises 
 your spirits, and you think good days are preparing 
 for you. Do not believe it. It can never be so. 
 Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. No 
 thing can bring you peace but the triumph of prin 
 ciples.</p>
