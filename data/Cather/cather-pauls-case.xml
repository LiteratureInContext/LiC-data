                <p> IT was Paul's afternoon to appear before the faculty of the <placeName
                        type="tgn" key="7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> High School to account for
                    his various misdemeanors. He had been suspended a week ago, and his father had
                    called at the principal's office and confessed his perplexity about his son.
                    Paul entered the faculty room, suave and smiling. His clothes were a trifle
                    outgrown, and the tan velvet on the collar of his open overcoat was frayed and
                    worn; but, for all that, there was something of the dandy about him, and he wore
                    an opal pin in his neatly knotted black four-in-hand, and a red carnation in his
                    buttonhole. This latter adornment the faculty somehow felt was not properly
                    significant of the contrite spirit befitting a boy under the ban of suspension. </p>
                <p> Paul was tall for his age and very thin, with high, cramped shoulders and a
                    narrow chest. His eyes were remarkable for a certain hysterical brilliancy, and
                    he continually used them in a conscious, theatrical sort of way, peculiarly
                    offensive in a boy. The pupils were abnormally large, as though he were addicted
                    to belladonna, but there was a glassy glitter about them which that drug does
                    not produce. </p>
                <p> When questioned by the principal as to why he was there, Paul stated, politely
                    enough, that he wanted to come back to school. This was a lie, but Paul was
                    quite accustomed to lyingâ€”found it, indeed, indispensible for overcoming
                    friction. His teachers were asked to state their respective charges, which they
                    did with such a rancour and aggrievedness as evinced that this was not a usual
                    case. Disorder and impertinence were among the offences named, yet each of his
                    instructors felt that it was scarcely possible to put into words the real cause
                    of the trouble, which lay in a sort of hysterically defiant manner of the boy's;
                    in the contempt which they all knew he felt for them, and which he seemingly
                    made not the least effort to conceal. Once, when he had been making a synopsis
                    of a paragraph at the blackboard, his English teacher had stepped to his side
                    and attempted to guide his hand. Paul had started back with a shudder, and
                    thrust his hands violently behind him. The astonished woman could scarcely have
                    been more hurt and embarrassed had he struck at her. The insult was so
                    involuntary and definitely personal as to be unforgettable. In one way and
                    another he had made all his teachers, men and women alike, conscious of the same
                    feeling of physical aversion. </p>
                <p> His teachers felt, this afternoon, that his whole attitude was symbolized by his
                    shrug and his flippantly red carnation flower, and they fell upon him without
                    mercy. He stood through it, smiling, his pale lips parted over his white teeth.
                    (His lips were continually twitching, and he had a habit of raising his eyebrows
                    that was contemptuous and irritating to the last degree.) Older boys than Paul
                    had broken down and shed tears under that baptism of fire, but his set smile did
                    not once desert him, and his only sign of discomfort was the nervous trembling
                    of the fingers that toyed with the buttons of his overcoat, and an occasional
                    jerking of the other hand that held his hat. Paul was always smiling, always
                    glancing about him, seeming to feel that people might be watching him and trying
                    to detect something. This conscious expression, since it was as far as possible
                    from boyish mirthfulness, was <note type="authorial" xml:id="fn1">
                        <hi rend="italic">* Author of "The Troll Garden," a book of short stories,
                            in which this is included.</hi>
                    </note>
                    <pb facs="pageImages/75.jpg" n="75"/> usually attributed to insolence or " smartness
                    ." </p>
                <p>As the inquisition proceeded, one of his instructors repeated an impertinent
                    remark of the boy's, and the principal asked him whether he thought that a
                    courteous speech to have made a woman. Paul shrugged his shoulders slightly and
                    his eyebrows twitched.</p>
                <p>"I don't know," he replied. "I didn't mean to be polite, or impolite, either. I
                    guess it's a sort of way I have of saying things, regardless."</p>
                <p> The principal, who was a sympathetic man, asked him whether he didn't think that
                    a way it would be well to get rid of. Paul grinned and said he guessed so. When
                    he was told that he could go, he bowed gracefully and went out. His bow was but
                    a repetition of the scandalous red carnation. </p>
                <p> His teachers were in despair, and his drawing-master voiced the feeling of them
                    all when he declared there was something about the boy which none of them
                    understood. He added: "I don't really believe that smile of his comes altogether
                    from insolence; there's something sort of haunted about it. The boy is not
                    strong, for one thing. I happen to know that he was born in Colorado, only a few
                    months before his mother died out there of a long illness. There is something
                    wrong about the fellow." </p>
                <p>The drawing-master had come to realize that, in looking at Paul, one saw only his
                    white teeth and the forced animation of his eyes. One warm afternoon the boy had
                    gone to sleep at his drawing-board, and his master had noted with amazement what
                    a white, blue-veined face it was; drawn and wrinkled like an old man's about the
                    eyes, the lips twitching even in his sleep, and stiff with a nervous tension
                    that drew them back from his teeth.</p>
                <p> As for Paul, he ran down the hill whistling the soldiers' chorus from "Faust,"
                    looking wildly behind him, now and then, to see whether some of his teachers
                    were not there to writhe under his light-heartedness. As it was now late in the
                    afternoon, and Paul was on duty that evening as usher in Carnegie Hall, he
                    decided that he would not go home to supper, but would hang about an Oakland
                    tobacconist's shop until it was time to go to the concert hall. </p>
                <p> When Paul reached the ushers' dressing-room at about half-past seven that
                    evening, half a dozen boys were there already, and Paul began, excitedly, to
                    tumble into his uniform. It was one of the few that at all approached fitting,
                    and he thought it very becoming, though he knew that the tight, straight coat
                    accentuated his narrow chest, about which he was exceedingly sensitive. He was
                    always considerably excited while he dressed, twanging all over to the tuning of
                    the strings and the preliminary flourishes of the horns in the music-room; but
                    to-night he seemed quite beside himself, and he teased and plagued the boys
                    until, telling him that he was crazy, they put him down on the floor and sat on
                    him. </p>
                <p>Somewhat calmed by his suppression, Paul dashed out to the front of the house to
                    seat the early comers.</p>
                <p>He was a model usher; gracious and smiling, he ran up and down the aisles;
                    nothing was too much trouble for him; he carried messages and brought programs
                    as though it were his greatest pleasure in life, and all the people in his
                    section thought him a charming boy, feeling that he remembered and admired them.
                    As the house filled, he grew more and more vivacious and animated, and the color
                    came to his cheeks and lips. It was very much as though this were a great
                    reception, and Paul were the host.</p>
                <p>When the symphony began, Paul sank into one of the rear seats, with a long sigh
                    of relief. It was not that symphonies, as such, meant anything in particular to
                    Paul, but the first sigh of the instruments seemed to free some hilarious and
                    potent spirit within himâ€” something that struggled there like the Genius in the
                    bottle found by the Arab fisherman. He felt a sudden zest of life; the lights
                    danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.
                    When the soprano soloist came on, Paul half closed his eyes, and gave himself up
                    to the peculiar stimulus such personages always had for him. The soloist chanced
                    to be a German woman, by no means in her first youth and the mother of many
                    children; but she wore an elaborate gown and a tiara, and above all, she had
                    that indefinable air of achievement, that world-shine upon her, which, in Paul's
                    eyes, made her a veritable queen of romance.</p>
                <p> After a concert was over Paul was always irritable and wretched until he got to
                    sleep, and to-night he was even more than usually restless. He had the feeling
                    of not being able to let down, of its being impossible to give up this delicious
                    excitement which was the only thing that could be called living <pb
                        facs="pageImages/76.jpg" n="76"/> at all. During the last number he withdrew,
                    and, after hastily changing his clothes in the dressing-room, slipped out to the
                    side door where the soprano's carriage stood. Here he began pacing rapidly up
                    and down the walk, waiting to see her come out. </p>
                <p> Over yonder the Schenley, in its vacant stretch, loomed big and square through
                    the fine rain, the windows of its twelve stories glowing like those of a lighted
                    cardboard house under a Christmas tree. All the actors and singers of the better
                    class stayed there when they were in the city, and a number of the big
                    manufacturers of the place lived there in the winter. Paul had often hung about
                    the hotel, watching the people go in and out, longing to enter and leave
                    school-masters and dull care behind him forever. </p>
                <p> At last the singer came out, accompanied by the conductor who helped her into
                    her carriage and closed the door with a cordial auf wiedersehen, which set Paul
                    to wondering whether she were not an old sweetheart of his. Paul followed the
                    carriage over to the hotel, walking so rapidly as not to be far from the
                    entrance when the singer alighted and disappeared behind the swinging glass
                    doors that were opened by a negro in a tall hat and a long coat. In the moment
                    that the door was ajar, it seemed to Paul that he too entered. He seemed to feel
                    himself go after her up the steps, into the warm, lighted building, into an
                    exotic, a tropical world of shiny, glistening surfaces and basking ease. He
                    reflected upon the mysterious dishes that were brought into the dining-room, the
                    green bottles in buckets of ice, as he had seen them in the supper-party
                    pictures of the Sunday <hi rend="italic">World</hi> supplement. A quick gust of
                    wind brought the rain down with sudden vehemence, and Paul was startled to find
                    that he was still outside in the slush of the gravel driveway; that his boots
                    were letting in the water, and his scanty overcoat was clinging wet about him;
                    that the lights in front of the concert hall were out, and that the rain was
                    driving in sheets between him and the orange glow of the windows above him.
                    There it was, what he wantedâ€”tangibly before him, like the fairy world of a
                    Christmas pantomime, but mocking spirits stood guard at the doors, and, as the
                    rain beat in his face, Paul wondered whether he were destined always to shiver
                    in the black night outside, looking up at it. </p>
                <p> He turned and walked reluctantly toward the car tracks. The end had to come
                    sometime; his father in his night-clothes at the top of the stairs, explanations
                    that did not explain, hastily improvised fictions that were forever tripping him
                    up, his upstairs room and its horrible yellow wall-paper, the creaking bureau
                    with the greasy plush collar box and over his painted wooden bed the pictures of
                    George Washington and John Calvin , and the framed motto, "Feed my Lambs," which
                    had been worked in red worsted by his mother. </p>
                <p> Half an hour later, Paul alighted from his car and went slowly down one of the
                    side streets off the main thoroughfare. It was a highly respectable street,
                    where all the houses were exactly alike, and where business men of moderate
                    means begot and reared large families of children, all of whom went to
                    Sabbath-school and learned the shorter catechism, and were interested in
                    arithmetic; all of whom were as exactly alike as their homes, and of a piece
                    with the monotony in which they lived. Paul never went up Cordelia Street
                    without a shudder of loathing . His home was next to the house of the Cumberland
                    minister. He approached it to-night with the nerveless sense of defeat, the
                    hopeless feeling of sinking back forever into ugliness and commonness that he
                    always had when he came home. The moment he turned into Cordelia Street he felt
                    the waters close above his head. After each of these orgies of living, he
                    experienced all the physical depression which follows a debauch; the loathing of
                    respectable beds, of common food, of a house penetrated by kitchen odors; a
                    shuddering repulsion for the flavorless , colorless mass of every-day existence;
                    a morbid desire for cool things and soft lights and fresh flowers. </p>
                <p>The nearer he approached the house, the more absolutely unequal Paul felt to the
                    sight of it all; his ugly sleeping chamber, the cold bath-room, with the grimy
                    zinc tub, the cracked mirror, the dripping spigots, his father at the top of the
                    stairs, his hairy legs sticking out from his night-shirt, his feet thrust into
                    carpet slippers. He was so much later than usual that there would certainly be
                    inquiries and reproaches. Paul stopped short before the door. He felt that he
                    could not be accosted by his father to-night, that he could not toss again on
                    that miserable bed. He would not go in. He would tell his father that he had no
                    car fare, and it was raining so hard he had gone home with one of the boys and
                    stayed all night.</p>
                <pb facs="pageImages/77.jpg" n="77"/>
                <p> Meanwhile, he was wet and cold. He went around to the back of the house and
                    tried one of the basement windows, found it open, raised it cautiously, and
                    scrambled down the cellar wall to the floor. There he stood, holding his breath,
                    terrified by the noise he had made, but the floor above him was silent, and
                    there was no creak on the stairs. He found a soap box, and carried it over to
                    the soft ring of light that streamed from the furnace door, and sat down. He was
                    horribly afraid of rats, so he did not try to sleep, but sat looking
                    distrustfully at the dark, still terrified least he might have awakened his
                    father. In such reactions, after one of the experiences which made days and
                    nights out of the dreary blanks of the calendar, when his senses were deadened ,
                    Paul's head was always singularly clear. Suppose his father had heard him
                    getting in at the window, and come down and shot him for a burglar? Then, again,
                    suppose his father had come down, pistol in hand, and he had cried out in time
                    to save himself, and his father had been horrified to think how nearly he had
                    killed him? Then, again, suppose a day should come when his father would
                    remember that night, and wish there had been no warning cry to stay his hand?
                    With this last supposition Paul entertained himself until daybreak. </p>
                <p> The following Sunday was fine; the sodden November chill was broken by the last
                    flash of autumnal summer. In the morning Paul had to go to church and
                    Sabbath-school, as always. On seasonable Sunday afternoons the burghers of
                    Cordelia Street always sat out on their front "stoops," and talked to their
                    neighbors on the next stoop, or called to those across the street in neighborly
                    fashion . The men usually sat on gay cushions placed upon the steps that led
                    down to the sidewalk, while the women, in their Sunday "waists," sat in rockers
                    on the cramped porches, pretending to be greatly at their ease. The children
                    played in the streets; there were so many of them that the place resembled the
                    recreation grounds of a kindergarten . The men on the stepsâ€”all in their shirt
                    sleeves, their vests unbuttonedâ€”sat with their legs well apart, their stomachs
                    comfortably protruding, and talked of the prices of things, or told anecdotes of
                    the sagacity of their various chiefs and overlords. They occasionally looked
                    over the multitude of squabbling children, listened affectionately to their
                    high-pitched, nasal voices, smiling to see their own proclivities reproduced in
                    their offspring, and interspersed their legends of the iron kings with remarks
                    about their sons' progress at school, their grades in arithmetic, and the
                    amounts they had saved in their toy banks. </p>
                <p>On this last Sunday of November, Paul sat all the afternoon on the lowest step of
                    his "stoop," staring into the street, while his sisters, in their rockers, were
                    talking to the minister's daughters next door about how many shirt-waists they
                    had made in the last week, and how many waffles some one had eaten at the last
                    church supper. When the weather was warm, and his father was in a particularly
                    jovial frame of mind, the girls made lemonade, which was always brought out in a
                    red glass pitcher, ornamented with forget-me-nots in blue enamel. This the girls
                    thought very fine, and the neighbors always joked about the suspicious color of
                    the pitcher.</p>
                <p> To-day Paul's father sat on the top step, talking to a young man who shifted a
                    restless baby from knee to knee. He happened to be the young man who was daily
                    held up to Paul as a model, and after whom it was his father's dearest hope that
                    he would pattern . This young man was of a ruddy complexion , with a compressed,
                    red mouth, and faded, near-sighted eyes, over which he wore thick spectacles,
                    with gold bows that curved about his ears. He was clerk to one of the magnates
                    of a great steel corporation, and was looked upon in Cordelia Street as a young
                    man with a future. There was a story that, some five years agoâ€”he was now barely
                    twenty-sixâ€”he had been a trifle dissipated, but in order to curb his appetites
                    and save the loss of time and strength that a sowing of wild oats might have
                    entailed, he had taken his chief's advice, oft reiterated to his employees, and
                    at twenty-one, had married the first woman whom he could persuade to share his
                    fortunes. She happened to be an angular schoolmistress, much older than he, who
                    also wore thick glasses, and who had now borne him four children, all
                    near-sighted, like herself. </p>
                <p> The young man was relating how his chief, now cruising in the Mediterranean,
                    kept in touch with all the details of the business , arranging his office hours
                    on his yacht just as though he were at home, and " knocking off work enough to
                    keep two stenographers busy." His father told, in turn, the plan his corporation
                    was considering, of putting <pb facs="pageImages/78.jpg" n="78"/> in an electric
                    railway plant at Cairo. Paul snapped his teeth; he had an awful apprehension
                    that they might spoil it all before he got there. Yet he rather liked to hear
                    these legends of the iron kings, that were told and retold on Sundays and
                    holidays; these stories of palaces in Venice, yachts on the Mediterranean, and
                    high play at Monte Carlo appealed to his fancy, and he was interested in the
                    triumphs of these cash-boys who had become famous, though he had no mind for the
                    cash-boy stage. </p>
                <p>After supper was over, and he had helped to dry the dishes, Paul nervously asked
                    his father whether he could go to George's to get some help in his geometry, and
                    still more nervously asked for car fare. This latter request he had to repeat,
                    as his father, on principle, did not like to hear requests for money, whether
                    much or little. He asked Paul whether he could not go to some boy who lived
                    nearer, and told him that he ought not to leave his school work until Sunday;
                    but he gave him the dime. He was not a poor man, but he had a worthy ambition to
                    come up in the world. His only reason for allowing Paul to usher was, that he
                    thought a boy ought to be earning a little.</p>
                <p> Paul bounded up-stairs, scrubbed the greasy odor of the dish-water from his
                    hands with the ill-smelling soap he hated, and then shook over his fingers a few
                    drops of violet water from the bottle he kept hidden in his drawer. He left the
                    house with his geometry conspicuously under his arm, and the moment he got out
                    of Cordelia Street and boarded a downtown car, he shook off the lethargy of two
                    deadening days, and began to live again. </p>
                <p>The leading juvenile of the permanent stock company which played at one of the
                    downtown theatres was an acquaintance of Paul's, and the boy had been invited to
                    drop in at the Sunday-night rehearsals whenever he could. For more than a year
                    Paul had spent every available moment loitering about Charley Edwards's
                    dressing-room. He had won a place among Edwards's following, not only because
                    the young actor, who could not afford to employ a dresser, often found the boy
                    very useful, but because he recognized in Paul something akin to what Churchmen
                    term 'vocation.'</p>
                <p> It was at the theatre and at Carnegie Hall that Paul really lived; the rest was
                    but a sleep and a forgetting. This was Paul's fairy tale, and it had for him all
                    the allurement of a secret love. The moment he inhaled the gassy, painty, dusty
                    odor behind the scenes, he breathed like a prisoner set free, and felt within
                    him the possibility of doing or saying splendid, brilliant, poetic things. The
                    moment the cracked orchestra beat out the overture from "Martha", or jerked at
                    the serenade from "Rigoletto," all stupid and ugly things slid from him, and his
                    senses were deliciously, yet delicately fired. </p>
                <p> Perhaps it was because, in Paul's world, the natural nearly always wore the
                    guise of ugliness, that a certain element of artificiality seemed to him
                    necessary in beauty. Perhaps it was because his experience of life elsewhere was
                    so full of Sabbath-school picnics , petty economies, wholesome advice as to how
                    to succeed in life, and the unescapable odors of cooking, that he found this
                    existence so alluring, these smartly clad men and women so attractive, that he
                    was so moved by these starry apple orchards that bloomed perennially under the
                    lime-light. </p>
                <p> It would be difficult to put it strongly enough how convincingly the stage
                    entrance of that theatre was for Paul the actual portal of Romance. Certainly
                    none of the company ever suspected it, least of all Charley Edwards . It was
                    very like the old stories that used to float about London of fabulously rich
                    Jews, who had subterranean halls there; with palms, and fountains, and soft
                    lamps, and richly appareled women who never saw the disenchanting light of
                    London day. So, in the midst of that smoke-palled city, enamored of figures and
                    grimy toil, Paul had his secret temple, his wishing carpet, his bit of
                    blue-and-white Mediterranean shore bathed in perpetual sunshine. </p>
                <p> Several of Paul's teachers had a theory that his imagination had been perverted
                    by garish fiction, but the truth was that he scarcely ever read at all. The
                    books at home were not such as would either tempt or corrupt a youthful mind,
                    and as for reading the novels that some of his friends urged upon himâ€”well, he
                    got what he wanted much more quickly from music; any sort of music , from an
                    orchestra to a barrel-organ. He needed only the spark, the indescribable thrill
                    that made his imagination master of his senses, and he could make plots and
                    pictures enough of his own. It was equally true that he was not
                    stage-struckâ€”not, at any rate, in the usual acceptation of that <pb
                        facs="pageImages/79.jpg" n="79"/> expression. He had no desire to become an
                    actor, any more than he had to become a musician. He felt no necessity to do any
                    of these things; what he wanted was to see, to be in the atmosphere, float on
                    the wave of it, to be carried out, blue league after blue league, away from
                    everything. </p>
                <p> After a night behind the scenes, Paul found the school-room more than ever
                    repulsive : the bare floors and naked walls, the prosy men who never wore
                    frock-coats, or violets in their button-holes; the women with their dull gowns,
                    shrill voices, and pitiful seriousness about prepositions that govern the
                    dative. He could not bear to have the other pupils think, for a moment, that he
                    took these people seriously; he must convey to them that he considered it all
                    trivial, and was there only by way of a jest, anyway. He had autograph pictures
                    of all the members of the stock company, which he showed his classmates, telling
                    them the most incredible stories of his familiarity with these people, of his
                    acquaintance with the soloists who came to Carnegie Hall, his suppers with them
                    and the flowers he sent them. When these stories lost their effect, and his
                    audience grew listless, he became desperate and would bid all the boys
                    good-night, announcing that he was going to travel for a while, going to Naples,
                    to Venice, to Egypt. Then, next Monday, he would slip back, conscious, and
                    nervously smiling; his sister was ill, and he should have to defer his voyage
                    until spring. </p>
                <p> Matters went steadily worse with Paul at school. In the itch to let his
                    instructors know how heartily he despised them and their homilies, and how
                    thoroughly he was appreciated elsewhere, he mentioned once or twice that he had
                    no time to fool with theorems; adding, with a twitch of the eyebrows and a touch
                    of that nervous bravado which so perplexed them, that he was helping the people
                    down at the stock company; they were old friends of his. </p>
                <p> The upshot of the matter was, that the principal went to Paul's father, and Paul
                    was taken out of school and put to work. The manager at Carnegie Hall was told
                    to get another usher in his stead, the doorkeeper at the theatre was warned not
                    to admit him to the house, and Charley Edwards remorsefully promised the boy's
                    father not to see him again. </p>
                <p> The members of the stock company were vastly amused when some of Paul's stories
                    reached themâ€”especially the women. They were hard-working women, most of them
                    supporting indigent husbands or brothers, and they laughed rather bitterly at
                    having stirred the boy to such fervid and florid inventions . They agreed with
                    the faculty and with his father that Paul's was a bad case. </p>

                <head type="sub">II</head>
                <p> The east-bound train was plowing through a January snow-storm; the dull dawn was
                    beginning to show gray, when the engine whistled a mile out of <placeName type="tgn" key="7014218">Newark</placeName>. Paul
                    started up from the seat where he had lain curled in uneasy slumber, rubbed the
                    breath-misted window-glass with his hand, and peered out. The snow was whirling
                    in curling eddies above the white bottom-lands, and the drifts lay already deep
                    in the fields and along the fences, while here and there the long dead grass and
                    dried weed stalks protruded black above it. Lights shone from the scattered
                    houses, and a gang of laborers who stood beside the track waved their lanterns. </p>
                <p>Paul had slept very little, and he felt grimy and uncomfortable. He had made the
                    all-night journey in a day coach, partly because he was ashamed, dressed as he
                    was, to go into a Pullman, and partly because he was afraid of being seen there
                    by some <placeName type="tgn" key="7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> business man,
                    who might have noticed him in Denny &amp; Carson's office. When the whistle
                    awoke him, he clutched quickly at his breast pocket, glancing about him with an
                    uncertain smile. But the little, clay-bespattered Italians were still sleeping,
                    the slatternly women across the aisle were in open-mouthed oblivion, and even
                    the crumby, crying babies were for the nonce stilled. Paul settled back to
                    struggle with his impatience as best he could.</p>
                <p> When he arrived at the Jersey City station , Paul hurried through his breakfast,
                    manifestly ill at ease and keeping a sharp eye about him. After he reached the
                    Twenty-third Street station, he consulted a cabman, and had himself driven to a
                    men's furnishing establishment that was just opening for the day. He spent
                    upward of two hours there, buying with endless reconsidering and great care. His
                    new street suit he put on in the fitting-room; the frock-coat and dress-clothes
                    he had bundled into the cab with his linen. Then he drove to a hatter's and a
                    shoe house. His next errand was at Tiffany's, where he selected his silver and a
                    new scarf-pin. He would not wait to have his silver marked, <pb
                        facs="pageImages/80.jpg" n="80"/> he said. Lastly, he stopped at a trunk shop on
                    Broadway, and had his purchases packed into various traveling bags. </p>
                <p>It was a little after one o'clock when he drove up to the Waldorf, and after
                    settling with the cabman, went into the office. He registered from Washington;
                    said his mother and father had been abroad, and that he had come down to await
                    the arrival of their steamer. He told his story plausibly and had no trouble,
                    since he volunteered to pay for them in advance, in engaging his rooms, a
                    sleeping-room, sitting-room and bath.</p>
                <p> Not once, but a hundred times, Paul had planned this entry into <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName>. He had
                    gone over every detail of it with Charley Edwards, and in his scrap-book at home
                    there were pages of description about <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName> hotels, cut from the Sunday
                    papers. When he was shown to his sitting-room on the eighth floor, he saw at a
                    glance that everything was as it should be; there was but one detail in his
                    mental picture that the place did not realize, so he rang for the bell-boy and
                    sent him down for flowers. He moved about nervously until the boy returned,
                    putting away his new linen and fingering it delightedly as he did so. When the
                    flowers came, he put them hastily into water, and then tumbled into a hot bath.
                    Presently he came out of his white bath-room, resplendent in his new silk
                    underwear, and playing with the tassels of his red robe. The snow was whirling
                    so fiercely outside his windows that he could scarcely see across the street but
                    within the air was deliciously soft and fragrant. He put the violets and
                    jonquils on the taboret beside the couch, and threw himself down, with a long
                    sigh, covering himself with a Roman blanket. He was thoroughly tired; he had
                    been in such haste, had stood up to such a strain, covered so much ground in the
                    last twenty-four hours, that he wanted to think how it had all come about.
                    Lulled by the sound of the wind, the warm air, and the cool fragrance of the
                    flowers, he sank into deep, drowsy retrospection. </p>
                <p> It had been wonderfully simple; when they had shut him out of the theatre and
                    concert hall, when they had taken away his bone, the whole thing was virtually
                    determined . The rest was a mere matter of opportunity . The only thing that at
                    all surprised him was his own courage, for he realized well enough that he had
                    always been tormented by fear, a sort of apprehensive dread that, of late years,
                    as the meshes of the lies he had told closed about him, had been pulling the
                    muscles of his body tighter and tighter. Until now, he could not remember the
                    time when he had not been dreading something. Even when he was a little boy, it
                    was always thereâ€”behind him, or before, or on either side. There had always been
                    the shadowed corner, the dark place into which he dared not look, but from which
                    something seemed always to be watching himâ€”and Paul had done things that were
                    not pretty to watch, he knew. </p>
                <p>But now he had a curious sense of relief, as though he had at last thrown down
                    the gauntlet to the thing in the corner.</p>
                <p> Yet it was but a day since he had been sulking in the traces; but yesterday
                    afternoon that he had been sent to the bank with Denny &amp; Carson's deposits
                    as usualâ€”but this time he was instructed to leave the book to be balanced. There
                    were above two thousand dollars in checks, and nearly a thousand in the
                    bank-notes which he had taken from the book and quietly transferred to his
                    pocket. At the bank he had made out a new deposit slip. His nerves had been
                    steady enough to permit of his returning to the office, where he had finished
                    his work and asked for a full day's holiday tomorrow , Saturday, giving a
                    perfectly reasonable pretext. The bank-book, he knew, would not be returned
                    before Monday or Tuesday, and his father would be out of town for the next week.
                    From the time he slipped the bank-notes into his pocket until he boarded the
                    night train for <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName>, he had not known a moment's hesitation. It was not the
                    first time Paul had steered through treacherous waters. </p>
                <p>How astonishingly easy it had all been; here he was, the thing done, and this
                    time there would be no awakening, no figure at the top of the stairs. He watched
                    the snow-flakes whirling by his window until he fell asleep.</p>
                <p> When he awoke, it was three o'clock in the afternoon. He bounded up with a
                    start; half of one of his precious days gone already! He spent more than an hour
                    in dressing, watching every stage of his toilet carefully in the mirror.
                    Everything was quite perfect ; he was exactly the kind of boy he had always
                    wanted to be. </p>
                <p> When he went down-stairs, Paul took a carriage and drove up Fifth Avenue toward
                    the Park. The snow had somewhat abated, carriages and tradesmen's wagons were
                        <pb facs="pageImages/81.jpg" n="81"/> hurrying to and fro in the winter
                    twilight, boys in woollen mufflers were shovelling off the doorsteps, the avenue
                    stages made fine spots of color against the white street. Here and there on the
                    corners were stands, with whole flower gardens blooming under glass cases,
                    against the sides of which the snow-flakes stuck and melted; violets, roses,
                    carnations, lilies of the valley, somehow vastly more lovely and alluring that
                    they blossomed thus unnaturally in the snow. The Park itself was a wonderful
                    stage winter-piece. </p>
                <p> When he returned, the pause of the twilight had ceased, and the tune of the
                    streets had changed. The snow was falling faster, lights streamed from the
                    hotels that reared their dozen stories fearlessly up into the storm, defying the
                    raging Atlantic winds. A long, black stream of carriages poured down the avenue,
                    intersected here and there by other streams, tending horizontally. There were a
                    score of cabs about the entrance of his hotel, and his driver had to wait. Boys
                    in livery were running in and out of the awning that was stretched across the
                    sidewalk, up and down the red velvet carpet laid from the door to the street.
                    Above, about, within it all was the rumble and roar, the hurry and toss of
                    thousands of human beings as hot for pleasure as himself, and on every side of
                    him towered the glaring affirmation of the omnipotence of wealth. </p>
                <p> The boy set his teeth and drew his shoulders together in a spasm of realization;
                    the plot of all dramas, the text of all romances, the nerve-stuff of all
                    sensations was whirling about him like the snow-flakes. He burnt like a faggot
                    in a tempest. </p>
                <p>When Paul went down to dinner, the music of the orchestra came floating up the
                    elevator shaft to greet him. His head whirled as he stepped into the thronged
                    corridor, and he sank back into one of the chairs against the wall to get his
                    breath. The lights, the chatter, the perfumes, the bewildering medley of
                    colorâ€”he had for a moment the feeling of not being able to stand it. But only
                    for a moment; these were his own people, he told himself. He went slowly about
                    the corridors, through the writing-rooms, smoking-rooms, reception-rooms, as
                    though he were exploring the chambers of an enchanted palace, built and peopled
                    for him alone.</p>
                <p> When he reached the dining-room he sat down at a table near a window. The
                    flowers, the white linen, the many-colored wine glasses, the gay toilettes of
                    the women, the low popping of corks, the undulating repetitions of the "Blue
                    Danube" from the orchestra, all flooded Paul's dream with bewildering radiance.
                    When the rosy tinge of his champagne was addedâ€”that cold, precious, bubbling
                    stuff that creamed and foamed in his glassâ€”Paul wondered that there were honest
                    men in the world at all. This was what all the world was fighting for, he
                    reflected; this was what all the struggle was about. He doubted the reality of
                    his past. Had he ever known a place called Cordelia Street, a place where
                    fagged- looking business men got on the early car; mere rivets in a machine,
                    they seemed to Paulâ€”sickening men, with combings of children's hair always
                    hanging to their coats, and the smell of cooking in their clothes. Cordelia
                    Streetâ€”Ah! that belonged to another time and country; had he not always been
                    thus, had he not sat here night after night, from as far back as he could
                    remember, looking pensively over just such shimmering textures and slowly
                    twirling the stem of a glass like this one between his thumb and middle finger?
                    He rather thought he had. </p>
                <p> He was not in the least abashed or lonely. He had no especial desire to meet or
                    to know any of these people; all he demanded was the right to look on and
                    conjecture, to watch the pageant. The mere stage properties were all he
                    contended for. Nor was he lonely later in the evening, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >loge</hi> at the Metropolitan. He was now entirely rid of his nervous
                    misgivings, of his forced aggressiveness , of the imperative desire to show
                    himself different from his surroundings. He felt now that his surroundings
                    explained him. Nobody questioned the purple; he had only to wear it passively.
                    He had only to glance down at his attire to reassure himself that here it would
                    be impossible for anyone to humiliate him. </p>
                <p>He found it hard to leave his beautiful sitting-room to go to bed that night, and
                    sat long watching the raging storm from his turret window. When he went to
                    sleep, it was with the lights turned on in his bedroom; partly because of his
                    old timidity and partly so that, if he should wake in the night, there would be
                    no wretched moment of doubt, no horrible suspicion of yellow wall-paper, or of
                    Washington and Calvin above his bed.</p>
                <p> Sunday morning the city was practically snow-bound. Paul breakfasted late, and
                        <pb facs="pageImages/82.jpg" n="82"/> in the afternoon he fell in with a wild
                    San Francisco boy, a freshman at Yale, who said he had run down for a "little
                    flyer" over Sunday. The young man offered to show Paul the night side of the
                    town, and the two boys went out together after dinner, not returning to the
                    hotel until seven o'clock the next morning. They had started out in the
                    confiding warmth of a champagne friendship , but their parting in the elevator
                    was singularly cool. The freshman pulled himself together to make his train and
                    Paul went to bed. He awoke at two o'clock in the afternoon, very thirsty and
                    dizzy, and rang for ice-water, coffee, and the <placeName type="tgn"
                        key="7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> papers. </p>
                <p> On the part of the hotel management, Paul excited no suspicion. There was this
                    to be said for him, that he wore his spoils with dignity and in no way made
                    himself conspicuous. Even under the glow of his wine he was never boisterous,
                    though he found the stuff like a magician's wand for wonder-building. His chief
                    greediness lay in his ears and eyes, and his excesses were not offensive ones.
                    His dearest pleasures were the gray winter twilights in his sitting-room; his
                    quiet enjoyment of his flowers, his clothes, his wide divan, his cigarette, and
                    his sense of power. He could not remember a time when he had felt so at peace
                    with himself . The mere release from the necessity of petty lying, lying every
                    day and every day, restored his self-respect. He had never lied for pleasure,
                    even at school, but to be noticed and admired, to assert his difference from
                    other Cordelia Street boys; and he felt a good deal more manly, more honest
                    even, now that he had no need for boastful pretensions , now that he could, as
                    his actor friends used to say, "dress the part." It was characteristic that
                    remorse did not occur to him. His golden days went by without a shadow, and he
                    made each as perfect as he could. </p>
                <p> On the eighth day after his arrival in <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName>, he found the whole affair
                    exploited in the <placeName type="tgn" key="7013927">Pittsburg</placeName>
                    papers, exploited with a wealth of detail which indicated that local news of a
                    sensational nature was at a low ebb. The firm of Denny &amp; Carson announced
                    that the boy's father had refunded the full amount of the theft, and that they
                    had no intention of prosecuting. The Cumberland minister had been interviewed,
                    and expressed his hope of yet reclaiming the motherless boy, and his
                    Sabbath-school teacher declared that she would spare no effort to that end. The
                    rumor had reached <placeName type="tgn" key="7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> that
                    the boy had been seen in a <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName> hotel, and his father had gone East to find
                    him and bring him home. </p>
                <p>Paul had just come in to dress for dinner; he sank into a chair, weak to the
                    knees, and clasped his head in his hands. It was to be worse than jail, even;
                    the tepid waters of Cordelia Street were to close over him finally and forever.
                    The gray monotony stretched before him in hopeless, unrelieved years;
                    Sabbath-school, Young People's Meeting, the yellow-papered room, the damp
                    dish-towels; it all rushed back upon him with a sickening vividness. He had the
                    old feeling that the orchestra had suddenly stopped, the sinking sensation that
                    the play was over. The sweat broke out on his face, and he sprang to his feet,
                    looked about him with his white, conscious smile, and winked at himself in the
                    mirror. With something of the old childish belief in miracles with which he had
                    so often gone to class, all his lessons unlearned, Paul dressed and dashed
                    whistling down the corridor to the elevator.</p>
                <p> He had no sooner entered the dining-room and caught the measure of the music
                    than his remembrance was lightened by his old elastic power of claiming the
                    moment, mounting with it, and finding it all-sufficient. The glare and glitter
                    about him, the mere scenic accessories had again, and for the last time, their
                    old potency. He would show himself that he was game, he would finish the thing
                    splendidly. He doubted, more than ever, the existence of Cordelia Street, and
                    for the first time he drank his wine recklessly. Was he not, after all, one of
                    those fortunate beings born to the purple, was he not still himself and in his
                    own place? He drummed a nervous accompaniment to the Pagliacci music and looked
                    about him, telling himself over and over that it had paid. </p>
                <p> He reflected drowsily, to the swell of the music and the chill sweetness of his
                    wine, that he might have done it more wisely. He might have caught an outbound
                    steamer and been well out of their clutches before now. But the other side of
                    the world had seemed too far away and too uncertain then; he could not have
                    waited for it; his need had been too sharp. If he had to choose over again, he
                    would do the same thing tomorrow. He looked affectionately about the
                    dining-room, now gilded with a soft mist. Ah, it had paid indeed! </p>
                <pb facs="pageImages/83.jpg" n="83"/>
                <p> Paul was awakened next morning by a painful throbbing in his head and feet. He
                    had thrown himself across the bed without undressing, and had slept with his
                    shoes on. His limbs and hands were lead heavy, and his tongue and throat were
                    parched and burnt. There came upon him one of those fateful attacks of
                    clear-headedness that never occurred except when he was physically exhausted and
                    his nerves hung loose. He lay still and closed his eyes and let the tide of
                    things wash over him. </p>
                <p>His father was in <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName>; "stopping at some joint or other," he told himself.
                    The memory of successive summers on the front stoop fell upon him like a weight
                    of black water. He had not a hundred dollars left; and he knew now, more than
                    ever, that money was everything, the wall that stood between all he loathed and
                    all he wanted. The thing was winding itself up; he had thought of that on his
                    first glorious day in <placeName type="tgn" key="7007567">New York</placeName>, and had even provided a way to snap the thread.
                    It lay on his dressing-table now; he had got it out last night when he came
                    blindly up from dinner, but the shiny metal hurt his eyes, and he disliked the
                    looks of the thing.</p>
                <p> He rose and moved about with a painful effort, succumbing now and again to
                    attacks of nausea. It was the old depression exaggerated ; all the world had
                    become Cordelia Street. Yet somehow, he was not afraid of anything, was
                    absolutely calm; perhaps because he had looked into the dark corner at last and
                    knew. It was bad enough, what he saw there, but somehow not so bad as his long
                    fear of it had been. He saw everything clearly now. He had a feeling that he had
                    made the best of it, that he had lived the sort of life he was meant to live,
                    and for half an hour he sat staring at the revolver. But he told himself that
                    was not the way, so he went down stairs and took a cab to the ferry. </p>
                <p> When Paul arrived at <placeName type="tgn" key="7014218">Newark</placeName>, he got off the train and took another cab,
                    directing the driver to follow the Pennsylvania tracks out of the town. The snow
                    lay heavy on the roadways and had drifted deep in the open fields. Only here and
                    there the dead grass or dried weed stalks projected, singularly black, above it.
                    Once well into the country, Paul dismissed the carriage and walked, floundering
                    along the tracks, his mind a medley of irrelevant things. He seemed to hold in
                    his brain an actual picture of everything he had seen that morning. He
                    remembered every feature of both his drivers, of the toothless old woman from
                    whom he had bought the red flowers in his coat, the agent from whom he had got
                    his ticket, and all of his fellow-passengers on the ferry. His mind, unable to
                    cope with vital matters near at hand, worked feverishly and deftly at sorting
                    and grouping these images. They made for him a part of the ugliness of the
                    world, of the ache in his head, and the bitter burning on his tongue. He stooped
                    and put a handful of snow into his mouth as he walked, but that, too, seemed
                    hot. When he reached a little hillside, where the tracks ran through a cut some
                    twenty feet below him, he stopped and sat down. </p>
                <p> The carnations in his coat were drooping with the cold, he noticed, their red
                    glory all over. It occurred to him that all the flowers he had seen in the glass
                    cases that first night must have gone the same way, long before this. It was
                    only one splendid breath they had, in spite of their brave mockery at the winter
                    outside the glass, and it was a losing game in the end, it seemed, this revolt
                    against the homilies by which the world is run. Paul took one of the blossoms
                    carefully from his coat and scooped a little hole in the snow, where he covered
                    it up. Then he dozed a while, from his weak condition, seemingly insensible to
                    the cold. </p>
                <p> The sound of an approaching train awoke him, and he started to his feet,
                    remembering only his resolution, and afraid lest he should be too late. He stood
                    watching the approaching locomotive, his teeth chattering, his lips drawn away
                    from them in a frightened smile; once or twice he glanced nervously sidewise, as
                    though he were being watched. When the right moment came, he jumped. As he fell,
                    the folly of his haste occurred to him with merciless clearness , the vastness
                    of what he had left undone . There flashed through his brain, clearer than ever
                    before, the blue of Adriatic water, the yellow of Algerian sands. </p>
                <p> He felt something strike his chest, and that his body was being thrown swiftly
                    through the air, on and on, immeasurably far and fast, while his limbs were
                    gently relaxed . Then, because the picture-making mechanism was crushed, the
                    disturbing visions flashed into black, and Paul dropped back into the immense
                    design of things. </p>
